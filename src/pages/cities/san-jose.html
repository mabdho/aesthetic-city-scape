Navigate its narrow alleyways to find everything from fresh produce, exotic fruits, and aromatic spices to leather goods, traditional crafts, and herbal remedies. It's the perfect place to sample authentic Costa Rican flavors.\n\nDon't leave without trying a 'casado' (a traditional plate of rice, beans, salad, plantains, and a choice of meat) from one of the small eateries known as 'sodas'. For a treat, stop by 'La Sorbetera de Lolo Mora' for a scoop of their famous cinnamon-infused ice cream, a secret recipe that has been passed down for generations.

Built by German architects in the late 19th century, its intricate facade and beautiful stained-glass windows stand out from the city's more common neoclassical or Spanish colonial styles. The interior is equally impressive, with a serene atmosphere, beautiful woodwork, and soaring vaulted ceilings.

Located just a few blocks from the Central Market, it's an easy and worthwhile stop on a walking tour of the city. Whether you are religious or simply an admirer of beautiful architecture, the Iglesia de la Merced offers a moment of peace and reflection away from the bustle of the city streets.</p>
