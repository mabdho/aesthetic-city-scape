      "description": "Dominating the city's coastline, the Hassan II Mosque is an architectural masterpiece and one of the largest mosques in the world. Commissioned by King Hassan II and completed in 1993, its 210-meter-tall minaret is the second tallest in the world, acting as a beacon for the city. Part of the mosque is built on land reclaimed from the sea, and its roof is retractable, allowing worshippers to pray under the stars on special occasions. The intricate details, from hand-carved stone and wood to stunning marble floors and zellij tilework, represent the finest Moroccan craftsmanship.\n\nAs one of the few mosques in Morocco open to non-Muslims, a guided tour is essential. The tours are conducted in multiple languages and provide fascinating insight into the building's construction, religious significance, and architectural symbolism. The sheer scale and beauty of the prayer hall are breathtaking, making this an unmissable highlight of any visit to Casablanca.",

      "description": "The Quartier Habous, or New Medina, was built by the French in the 1930s as a solution to housing shortages. It was designed to blend traditional Moroccan architecture with French urban planning, resulting in a charming, clean, and well-organized medina. Its neat alleyways are lined with arcades, souks, and beautiful buildings that house everything from artisan workshops to modern cafes. It's a more relaxed shopping experience than the Old Medina, ideal for finding quality Moroccan goods like leather babouches, djellabas, spices, and pastries.\n\nDon't miss the olive souk, the brass and copperware artisans, and Pâtisserie Bennis, a legendary spot for authentic Moroccan sweets. The area's blend of Moorish and European styles makes for a delightful and photogenic wander.",

      "description": "Step back in time in Casablanca's Old Medina, the original walled city predating the French protectorate. This labyrinth of narrow, winding streets is a world away from the modern boulevards surrounding it. While not as vast or polished as the medinas of Fes or Marrakech, it offers an authentic, gritty glimpse into traditional city life. Here, you'll find locals haggling for produce, artisans in tiny workshops, and children playing in hidden squares.\n\nThe medina's northern bastion, the Sqala, offers great views of the port and the Hassan II Mosque. It's a place to get lost and observe daily life, but it's wise to be mindful of your belongings and visit during daylight hours for the best experience.",

You can relax at a public beach or pay for entry to a private beach club for a more exclusive experience with pools and amenities.\n\nAs evening approaches, the area comes alive with people flocking to its many bars and restaurants to enjoy dinner with a view of the sunset. It offers a modern, Westernized side of Casablanca, contrasting sharply with the historic medina.",

This grand central plaza is surrounded by impressive public buildings constructed during the French colonial era, showcasing a unique architectural style known as Mauresque. This style beautifully melds traditional Moroccan design elements with European Art Deco. Key buildings include the Wilaya (government offices), the courthouse (Palais de Justice), the Bank Al-Maghrib, and the main post office.\n\nThe square features a large central fountain and is a hub of activity, especially in the evening when locals gather.

Opened in 2004 by a former American diplomat, this beautifully restored riad is a meticulous recreation of the bar made famous by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. The atmosphere is thick with 1940s nostalgia, featuring a grand piano, curved archways, intricate tilework, and moody lighting.\n\nMore than just a tourist gimmick, Rick's offers a high-quality dining experience with a menu of Moroccan and international cuisine. A jazz pianist plays classic tunes, including 'As Time Goes By,' nightly. Reservations are highly recommended, especially for dinner. It's a chance to indulge in a bit of cinematic fantasy in the city that inspired it.",

Its stunning design is a masterpiece of Neo-Gothic architecture blended with Moroccan decorative elements and Art Deco influences. Though it was deconsecrated and ceased its religious function after Morocco gained independence in 1956, its soaring white facade and twin towers remain an iconic part of Casablanca's skyline.\n\nToday, the cathedral is used as a cultural center, hosting art exhibitions and events. Visitors can admire its grand exterior and, when open, explore its vast, empty interior, which highlights the unique architectural fusion. The play of light through its stained-glass windows is particularly beautiful.",

Its interior is a breathtaking display of traditional Moroccan craftsmanship, featuring intricate zellij tilework, carved cedarwood ceilings, white marble columns, and elegant stucco work.\n\nAlthough it is still an active government building (prefecture offices), it is sometimes possible for tourists to gain entry. You may need to ask a guard for permission, and a small tip is often expected. If you can get inside, the magnificent courtyards and grand halls make it well worth the effort.

This small village and marabout (shrine of a holy man) is built on a rocky outcrop just off the Corniche coast, accessible only by a small bridge during low tide. The shrine itself is reserved for Muslims, but visitors are welcome to explore the tiny, whitewashed village that has sprung up around it.\n\nThe village is a photogenic jumble of houses, and it is home to a community of soothsayers and fortune-tellers who cater to pilgrims seeking blessings or cures.

                    <h3>Hassan II Mosque</h3>
                    <p>Dominating the city's coastline, the Hassan II Mosque is an architectural masterpiece and one of the largest mosques in the world. Commissioned by King Hassan II and completed in 1993, its 210-meter-tall minaret is the second tallest in the world, acting as a beacon for the city. Part of the mosque is built on land reclaimed from the sea, and its roof is retractable, allowing worshippers to pray under the stars on special occasions. The intricate details, from hand-carved stone and wood to stunning marble floors and zellij tilework, represent the finest Moroccan craftsmanship.

As one of the few mosques in Morocco open to non-Muslims, a guided tour is essential. The tours are conducted in multiple languages and provide fascinating insight into the building's construction, religious significance, and architectural symbolism.

                    <h3>Quartier Habous (New Medina)</h3>
                    <p>The Quartier Habous, or New Medina, was built by the French in the 1930s as a solution to housing shortages. It was designed to blend traditional Moroccan architecture with French urban planning, resulting in a charming, clean, and well-organized medina. Its neat alleyways are lined with arcades, souks, and beautiful buildings that house everything from artisan workshops to modern cafes. It's a more relaxed shopping experience than the Old Medina, ideal for finding quality Moroccan goods like leather babouches, djellabas, spices, and pastries.

Don't miss the olive souk, the brass and copperware artisans, and Pâtisserie Bennis, a legendary spot for authentic Moroccan sweets. The area's blend of Moorish and European styles makes for a delightful and photogenic wander.</p>

                    <p>Step back in time in Casablanca's Old Medina, the original walled city predating the French protectorate. This labyrinth of narrow, winding streets is a world away from the modern boulevards surrounding it. While not as vast or polished as the medinas of Fes or Marrakech, it offers an authentic, gritty glimpse into traditional city life. Here, you'll find locals haggling for produce, artisans in tiny workshops, and children playing in hidden squares.

The medina's northern bastion, the Sqala, offers great views of the port and the Hassan II Mosque. It's a place to get lost and observe daily life, but it's wise to be mindful of your belongings and visit during daylight hours for the best experience.</p>

Its stunning design is a masterpiece of Neo-Gothic architecture blended with Moroccan decorative elements and Art Deco influences. Though it was deconsecrated and ceased its religious function after Morocco gained independence in 1956, its soaring white facade and twin towers remain an iconic part of Casablanca's skyline.

Today, the cathedral is used as a cultural center, hosting art exhibitions and events. Visitors can admire its grand exterior and, when open, explore its vast, empty interior, which highlights the unique architectural fusion.

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Casablanca is a large, sprawling city. For short distances in the center, walking is feasible. 'Petit Taxis' (small, red taxis) are metered and ideal for trips within the city limits; always insist on the meter. 'Grand Taxis' (larger, white cars) operate on fixed routes and are shared. The Casa Tramway is modern, efficient, and great for connecting key areas like the city center, the Corniche, and the train stations.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>For first-time visitors, the city center near Place Mohammed V and the Art Deco district offers convenient access to many sights and the tram. For a luxury experience with ocean views, the Corniche in the Anfa district is packed with high-end hotels and beach clubs. The area around Quartier Habous provides a more local, charming atmosphere, though it is further from the main attractions.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Casablanca safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Casablanca is generally safe for tourists, but like any large city, it requires common sense and awareness. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, can occur in crowded areas like the Old Medina and markets. It's advisable to dress modestly, avoid wearing flashy jewelry, and keep valuables secure. Stick to well-lit main streets at night and be cautious of unsolicited guides. Using official taxis is recommended over unmarked cars.</div>
