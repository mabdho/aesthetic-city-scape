Beautifully restored buildings with wrought-iron balconies sit alongside character-filled ruins, creating a unique and photogenic atmosphere.

The Parque Natural Metropolitano is the only wildlife refuge in Central America located within a city's municipal boundaries. Spanning 232 hectares, this 'city lung' features several well-marked trails that wind through dense jungle, leading to lookout points with panoramic views of the city, the canal, and Ancon Hill. It's an incredible place for birdwatching and wildlife spotting; you might encounter sloths, agoutis, iguanas, and Geoffroy's tamarins.

The museum's striking exterior is a prelude to the fascinating story it tells inside: the story of how the isthmus of Panama rose from the sea, uniting two continents and changing the planet's biodiversity forever. Eight permanent galleries use interactive exhibits and stunning visual displays to explore Panama's unique natural heritage and its immense global impact.

This was the first permanent European settlement on the Pacific Ocean. In 1671, after being looted and destroyed by pirate Henry Morgan, the city was relocated to what is now Casco Viejo. Today, the archaeological site is a UNESCO World Heritage site where you can wander among the stone remnants of cathedrals, convents, and homes. Climb the restored bell tower of the old cathedral for a fantastic 360-degree view that juxtaposes the ancient ruins with the modern city skyline.",

This 199-meter (653-foot) hill is a protected reserve and a prominent landmark, easily identified by the giant Panamanian flag flying at its summit. The paved road to the top is a steep but manageable 30-40 minute walk, closed to private vehicles. As you ascend, keep an eye out for sloths, toucans, and deer. The reward at the top is a breathtaking vista encompassing Casco Viejo, the modern skyline, the Amador Causeway, and the Bridge of the Americas. It's best to go early in the morning to avoid the midday heat.",

Located at the edge of Casco Viejo where the Cinta Costera begins, this bustling market is where the city's fishermen bring their daily catch. Downstairs, you can see vendors selling a huge variety of fresh fish and seafood. Upstairs, and in the numerous stalls outside, you'll find simple eateries serving up incredibly fresh dishes. The star of the show is the Panamanian-style ceviche—raw fish cured in lime juice, onions, and cilantro, typically served with crackers or fried plantains. It's cheap, delicious, and an authentic taste of Panama.",

This park is a world-renowned birding destination, particularly along the famous Pipeline Road, where an Audubon Society Christmas Bird Count once recorded over 500 species in a single day. Even if you're not an expert birder, a walk through the dense rainforest is a fantastic experience. The park is also home to monkeys, sloths, agoutis, and other tropical wildlife. Visiting the Panama Rainforest Discovery Center within the park allows you to climb a 32-meter observation tower for a canopy-level view.",

These tours typically depart from a dock in Gamboa, about 45 minutes from the city. As you cruise along the channels of the canal, your guide will navigate to a series of small islands that are home to thriving populations of capuchin, howler, and tamarin monkeys. The monkeys are accustomed to the tour boats and will often come right up to the vessel, offering incredible photo opportunities.

Housed in a beautifully restored building in Casco Viejo that once served as the original headquarters for the French Canal Company, the museum details the entire saga of the canal. Exhibits cover the early Spanish colonial attempts, the disastrous French effort, the successful American construction, and the eventual handover to Panama. It’s a must-visit for history enthusiasts who want a more profound understanding of the canal's geopolitical and human significance.",

Located in the El Cangrejo neighborhood on Via España, its dramatic Gothic design stands in stark contrast to the modern skyscrapers and colonial buildings found elsewhere in the city. Built in the mid-20th century, its intricate stonework, towering spires, and beautiful stained-glass windows are reminiscent of a medieval European cathedral. Whether you're religious or simply an admirer of architecture, it's worth a visit to appreciate its unique beauty, both inside and out. It is an active church, so be respectful if a service is in progress.",

Located about 45 minutes from the city near Soberanía National Park, this experience lifts you from the forest floor, through the understory, and up into the lush canopy. The slow, peaceful ride allows for fantastic views and opportunities to spot wildlife like sloths, monkeys, and exotic birds in their natural habitat. The journey culminates at an observation tower with spectacular views over Gatun Lake and the Chagres River. It's a serene and accessible way to experience the rainforest canopy without strenuous hiking.",

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Panama City is during the dry season, which runs from mid-December to April. During these months, you can expect sunny skies, lower humidity, and minimal rain, making it ideal for exploring outdoor attractions. The wet season (or 'green season') from May to early December sees more frequent, but often short-lived, afternoon downpours. The landscape is lusher during this time, and you may find better deals on flights and accommodation.</p>

Using official taxis or ride-sharing apps is recommended over hailing cabs on the street.</div>
