                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Darwin's CBD is compact and walkable. For longer distances, the Buslink public bus network is efficient. E-scooters and e-bikes are popular for short trips around the city and waterfront. Taxis and rideshare services are readily available.

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Darwin is during the dry season, from May to October. During these months, you can expect warm, sunny days with low humidity and cool nights, perfect for outdoor activities. The wet season (November to April) is characterized by high humidity, monsoonal downpours, and spectacular thunderstorms. While some attractions may have limited access, this 'green season' showcases the landscape at its most lush and dramatic.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Darwin expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Darwin can be more expensive than other Australian capital cities. Flights and accommodation are priciest during the peak dry season (May-October).

However, many key attractions like the botanic gardens and some markets are free, and you can save money by using public transport and booking tours and accommodation well in advance.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Darwin safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Darwin is generally a safe city for tourists, but like any city, it's wise to take standard precautions. Be aware of your surroundings at night and secure your belongings. The most significant safety concerns are related to wildlife and the environment. Never swim in any un-designated waterways due to the presence of saltwater crocodiles. During the wet season (October to May), be cautious of Irukandji and Box jellyfish (stingers) in the ocean; swim only in protected areas like the Waterfront Lagoon.</div>
