                    <h3>American International Rattlesnake Museum</h3>
                    <p>Located in the heart of Old Town, this small, quirky museum is dedicated to one of the desert's most misunderstood creatures. The American International Rattlesnake Museum holds the world's largest collection of different species of live rattlesnakes, all housed in safely recreated naturalistic habitats. It's a surprisingly fascinating and educational stop.

The exhibits dispel common myths about rattlesnakes and teach visitors about their vital role in the ecosystem. You'll also see a wide array of snake-related art, artifacts, and memorabilia. It only takes about an hour to see everything, making it a perfect, quick addition to your Old Town explorations. For a small fee, you can get a 'Certificate of Bravery' for surviving your visit.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Albuquerque is a sprawling city, and renting a car is the most convenient way to explore, especially for accessing attractions like Sandia Peak and the Petroglyph National Monument. The city is served by Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ). Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft are widely available. The public transportation system, ABQ RIDE, offers bus routes throughout the city, but service can be infrequent in some areas. For travel between Albuquerque and Santa Fe, the New Mexico Rail Runner Express is an excellent option.</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best times to visit Albuquerque are spring (April-May) and fall (September-October) when the weather is mild and pleasant. Fall is particularly special due to the International Balloon Fiesta in early October and the smell of roasting green chile in the air. Summers (June-August) are hot and sunny, with temperatures often exceeding 95Â°F (35Â°C), though evenings are cool. Winters (November-February) are cool and crisp, with occasional snowfall, but still plenty of sunshine.</p>
