You can spot giraffes, zebras, blue wildebeest, eland, and sable antelope. The park is also a designated sanctuary for the endangered white rhino, and seeing these majestic animals is a major highlight. With a network of well-maintained roads, the park is easily navigable by a standard vehicle or you can hire a game-viewing vehicle at the entrance.

This living market is comprised of a series of thatched-roof huts where you can watch artisans at work, practicing traditional skills like wood carving, pottery, and weaving. It's one of the best places in Lusaka to buy high-quality, authentic souvenirs directly from the people who made them. You'll find everything from intricate wooden sculptures and masks to colourful textiles, tribal drums, and beaded jewellery. The atmosphere is relaxed, and the sellers are generally friendly and open to a bit of good-natured bargaining.

Kalimba Reptile Park is home to an impressive collection of crocodiles, snakes, tortoises, and other reptiles. Guided tours provide fascinating information about the different species, including some of Zambia's most venomous snakes, safely housed behind glass. The highlight for many is the Nile crocodile enclosure, where you can see these prehistoric giants basking in the sun. The park also has a pleasant recreational area with swimming pools, a playground, and a restaurant famous for its crocodile meat dishes (for the adventurous foodie). It’s a well-maintained and educational facility that offers a different kind of wildlife experience.",

The lower gallery is dedicated to the country's rich history and ethnography, showcasing traditional village life, witchcraft artifacts, and the long struggle for independence from British rule. The upper gallery features contemporary Zambian art, displaying a rotating collection of paintings and sculptures from talented local artists.

Located on Independence Avenue, the Freedom Statue depicts a man breaking his chains, a powerful symbol of Zambia's liberation from colonial rule. The statue commemorates the freedom fighters who died during the struggle for independence, which was achieved in 1964. It’s a place of national pride and is often the site of official commemorations. While you only need a short time to see it, a visit offers a moment of reflection on the country's history. It's an excellent photo opportunity and is located close to the Lusaka National Museum, making it easy to combine the two sights.",

This is not a tourist market; it's one of Lusaka's largest and most hectic hubs of commerce. Here, you'll find everything from fresh produce and dried fish to secondhand clothes ('salaula'), electronics, and household goods. The market is a sensory overload in the best way possible—a maze of narrow alleys, shouting vendors, and a kaleidoscope of colours and smells. It offers a raw and unfiltered glimpse into the daily life of Lusaka's residents. It's advisable to go with a local guide or be very mindful of your belongings, but for the adventurous traveler, it’s an unforgettable experience.",

Located near the showgrounds, this market is also held on Sundays and features a mix of crafts, secondhand goods, plants, and food stalls. It's less polished and more eclectic, giving you a better sense of a genuine community market. You can find unique items and often at lower prices than at the more prominent tourist spots. It's an excellent alternative for those looking to get slightly off the beaten path and engage in a more authentic market experience.",

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Getting around Lusaka is best done by taxi. Ride-sharing apps like Ulendo and Yango are popular, safe, and generally more affordable than hailing a cab on the street. For longer distances or day trips, hiring a private car and driver is a good option. Local minibuses are the cheapest way to travel but can be crowded and confusing for first-time visitors; they are recommended only for the more adventurous.</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Lusaka is during the dry season, from May to October. The weather is mild and pleasant, with sunny days and cool nights, making it ideal for exploring the city and for wildlife viewing in the nearby parks. The 'emerald' or green season, from November to April, sees frequent rain and higher humidity, but the landscape is lush and beautiful, and it's the best time for birdwatching.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Lusaka expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Lusaka can be moderately expensive, especially compared to rural Zambia, but it is generally more affordable than major Western cities. Accommodation will be your biggest expense, with international-style hotels costing $150-$300+ USD per night. Mid-range guesthouses are available for $50-$100. Eating at local restaurants is very cheap, while dining at upscale establishments in malls or hotels is comparable to Western prices. Activities like visiting national parks have tiered pricing, with international visitors paying the most, but costs are still reasonable (e.g., $15-$20 park entry).</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Two to three full days are sufficient to cover the main highlights of Lusaka, including the key cultural sites, wildlife attractions on the outskirts, and markets.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Lusaka safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Lusaka is relatively safe for tourists, but like any large city, it requires common sense and awareness. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, can occur, especially in crowded areas like markets and bus stations. It is advisable not to walk alone at night; use a reputable taxi service like Ulendo. Avoid displaying expensive valuables openly. The main tourist areas and affluent suburbs are generally secure, but be cautious in high-density residential areas ('compounds') and downtown after dark.</div>
