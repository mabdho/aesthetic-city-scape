                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Navigating Lagos is an adventure. Ride-sharing apps like Uber and Bolt are the most convenient and relatively safe options for tourists. For shorter distances, 'Keke Napep' (motorized tricycles) are common. The iconic yellow 'Danfo' buses are the cheapest way to get around but can be crowded and chaotic, recommended only for the adventurous. The city's BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system offers a more structured bus service on dedicated lanes.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>Victoria Island (VI) is the commercial hub, bustling with restaurants, bars, and hotels catering to business and leisure travelers. Ikoyi is a more upscale, residential area with luxury hotels and serene streets. The Lekki Peninsula is a modern, rapidly growing area popular with expats and younger crowds, offering a mix of hotels and serviced apartments. For a more historic feel, staying on Lagos Island provides proximity to key cultural sites.</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Lagos is during the dry season, which runs from October to March. During this period, rainfall is minimal, making it easier to explore the city. Be aware of the Harmattan season (December to February), which brings dry, dusty winds from the Sahara, sometimes causing hazy skies. The rainy season (April to September) is characterized by heavy downpours and can lead to significant flooding and traffic disruptions.</p>
