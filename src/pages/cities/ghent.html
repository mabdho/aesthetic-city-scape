      "description": "Dominating the Ghent skyline, the Gravensteen is a formidable 12th-century stone castle that looks straight out of a fairytale. Originally built by Philip of Alsace, the Count of Flanders, it served as a seat of power, a courthouse, and even a cotton mill before its restoration. A visit here is a journey back in time.\n\nThe self-guided audio tour is highly recommended; it's narrated with a healthy dose of Flemish humor and brings the castle's grim and glorious history to life. You can explore the ramparts, the keep, and the count's residence. The castle also houses a unique collection of torture devices, offering a chilling glimpse into medieval justice. The panoramic views of Ghent from the top are simply breathtaking.",

      "description": "A masterpiece of Gothic architecture, St. Bavo's Cathedral is a spiritual and artistic sanctuary. While its soaring nave, ornate pulpit, and Rubens' 'Saint Bavo enters the Convent at Ghent' are impressive, the main draw is a single, world-renowned artwork: 'The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb' by the Van Eyck brothers. Completed in 1432, this polyptych altarpiece is considered a pinnacle of Western art and has a dramatic history of being stolen, hidden, and rescued multiple times.\nThe recently opened visitor's center uses augmented reality to help you explore the masterpiece's details and symbolism before you see the restored panels in person. It's an unforgettable experience for art and history lovers alike.",

      "description": "The Graslei and Korenlei are the two quays that line the Leie river, forming the historic heart of Ghent. This is arguably the most beautiful view in the city, where a stunning row of historic guildhalls reflects in the water. By day, it's a bustling hub where locals and tourists alike gather on the banks to chat, drink, and watch the boats go by. The atmosphere is vibrant and cheerful.\nAs evening descends, the buildings are beautifully illuminated, creating a magical, romantic setting. Many canal boat tours start here, offering a different perspective of the facades. Grab a Belgian beer or a coffee from a nearby café and simply soak in the view – it’s a quintessential Ghent experience.",

      "name": "The Belfry of Ghent",
      "description": "As the tallest belfry in Belgium and a UNESCO World Heritage site, the 91-meter-high Ghent Belfry is a powerful symbol of the city's independence and wealth. Construction started in 1313, and it served as a watchtower and housed the city's charters of privileges. Atop the spire sits a gilded copper dragon, the city's guardian.\nYou can climb the stairs (or take the elevator for most of the way) to the top for an unparalleled 360-degree view of Ghent. Along the way, you'll pass the impressive carillon with its 54 bells. Hearing the bells chime while looking out over the medieval rooftops is a truly memorable moment.",

      "description": "For the perfect postcard picture of Ghent, head to St. Michael's Bridge (Sint-Michielsbrug). This is the only spot in the city where you can capture Ghent's three famous medieval towers in a single frame: St. Nicholas' Church, the Belfry, and St. Bavo's Cathedral. It’s a photographer’s dream, especially during the golden hour or at night when the city is illuminated.\nBeyond the towers, the bridge offers stunning views of the Graslei and Korenlei, with their historic facades reflected in the Leie river. The bridge itself, with its ornate lanterns and statue of the Archangel Michael, is a beautiful piece of architecture. It’s the central point from which to orient yourself and appreciate the architectural splendor of the city.",

      "description": "Seeing Ghent from the water offers a completely different perspective on its history and architecture. A guided canal boat tour is a relaxing and informative way to spend an hour. As you glide along the Leie and Lieve canals, you'll pass under historic bridges and get up-close views of the Graslei, the Gravensteen, and hidden corners of the city you might otherwise miss.\nMost tours provide commentary in multiple languages, sharing fascinating anecdotes about the city's past, from its prosperous trading days to the lives of the people who lived in the waterside houses. It's a great activity to do early in your trip to get a feel for the city's layout and history.",

The collection is eclectic and engaging, showcasing everything from whimsical furniture and artistic objects to everyday industrial design.\nThe museum is known for its well-curated temporary exhibitions that often tackle current social themes through the lens of design. It’s a refreshing contrast to the city's medieval attractions and provides a fascinating insight into Belgium's influential role in the world of design.",

This area, nestled beside the Gravensteen, feels like a village within the city. Its history dates back to the 10th century, and the beautifully preserved houses once belonged to leather tanners and weavers.\nToday, Patershol is a culinary hotspot, packed with an incredible density of high-quality restaurants offering everything from traditional Flemish cuisine to exotic international flavors. It's the perfect place for a romantic evening stroll, followed by a memorable dinner in one of its cozy, atmospheric establishments.",

      "description": "The Vrijdagmarkt is one of Ghent's most important historic squares, a place that has been the center of public life for centuries. It was here that monarchs were officially received, but also where disputes were settled and executions took place. Dominating the square is the statue of Jacob van Artevelde, a local hero who sided with England during the Hundred Years' War.\nTrue to its name, a lively market takes over the square every Friday morning, a tradition that has continued for hundreds of years. On Saturdays, it hosts a smaller food and flea market. Surrounded by historic guildhalls and bustling pubs, it's a great place to people-watch and soak in the local atmosphere.",

      "description": "The oldest and most prominent of Ghent's 'three towers', St. Nicholas' Church (Sint-Niklaaskerk) is a magnificent example of the local Scheldt Gothic style. Built from blue-gray stone from the Tournai area, its most striking feature is the central lantern tower, which allowed light to flood into the transept. This design was influential on later cathedrals, including St. Bavo's.\nFunded by Ghent's wealthy merchants and guilds, the church was a reflection of the city's prosperity. Step inside to appreciate the impressive organ and the quiet, contemplative atmosphere. Its location right next to the Korenmarkt makes it an unmissable landmark on any walking tour of the city.",

This narrow alleyway serves as a legal canvas for local and international street artists. It's a living exhibition, constantly changing as new layers of paint cover old ones. One week you might see a detailed portrait, and the next it could be replaced by bold lettering or an abstract design.\nIt's a vibrant explosion of color and creativity that offers a stark contrast to the medieval architecture just steps away. Take a slow walk through, admire the talent on display, and don't forget your camera. It's a dynamic snapshot of Ghent's contemporary urban culture.",

Housed in a beautifully restored 14th-century abbey with a sleek, modern entrance, this museum tells the story of Ghent's evolution from a medieval metropolis to the vibrant city it is today. It’s far from a stuffy history museum; the exhibits are interactive, engaging, and cleverly designed.\nThe highlight for many is a giant, walk-on aerial photograph of the city printed on the floor, allowing you to 'walk' through Ghent. The 'View of Ghent' multimedia presentation offers a fascinating, fast-paced overview of its history. It's the perfect place to start your visit to get context for everything else you'll see.",

The focus is primarily on Belgian and Flemish art, making it a must-see for anyone interested in the region's artistic heritage. Here you can admire masterpieces by Hieronymus Bosch, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony van Dyck.\nThe museum's collection of modern art from the 19th and early 20th centuries, including works by Belgian surrealists like René Magritte and symbolists like Fernand Khnopff, is also outstanding.

      "description": "Directly opposite the classical MSK is its rebellious younger sibling, the S.M.A.K. This is Ghent's hub for contemporary and avant-garde art, known for its provocative and often challenging exhibitions. The permanent collection features major international artists like Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, alongside influential Belgian artists such as Luc Tuymans.\nThe museum is celebrated for its dynamic temporary shows that push the boundaries of art. If you're looking for something that will make you think and question, S.M.A.K. delivers. Visiting both the MSK and S.M.A.K. in one trip provides a fantastic journey through centuries of art history and innovation.",

The Groot Vleeshuis was originally a central place for selling and inspecting meat. Today, its magnificent open timber roof is still its most striking feature, but now, large Ganda Hams hang from the rafters, curing in the open air.\nThe hall has been repurposed as a promotional center for East Flemish regional products. You can browse and buy local specialties, from Tierenteyn mustard and cuberdon candies to local beers and cheeses. There's also a restaurant inside where you can sample these products firsthand. It's a unique and delicious stop for any foodie.",

                    <p>Dominating the Ghent skyline, the Gravensteen is a formidable 12th-century stone castle that looks straight out of a fairytale. Originally built by Philip of Alsace, the Count of Flanders, it served as a seat of power, a courthouse, and even a cotton mill before its restoration. A visit here is a journey back in time.

The self-guided audio tour is highly recommended; it's narrated with a healthy dose of Flemish humor and brings the castle's grim and glorious history to life. You can explore the ramparts, the keep, and the count's residence. The castle also houses a unique collection of torture devices, offering a chilling glimpse into medieval justice. The panoramic views of Ghent from the top are simply breathtaking.</p>

                    <h3>St. Bavo's Cathedral & The Mystic Lamb</h3>
                    <p>A masterpiece of Gothic architecture, St. Bavo's Cathedral is a spiritual and artistic sanctuary. While its soaring nave, ornate pulpit, and Rubens' 'Saint Bavo enters the Convent at Ghent' are impressive, the main draw is a single, world-renowned artwork: 'The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb' by the Van Eyck brothers. Completed in 1432, this polyptych altarpiece is considered a pinnacle of Western art and has a dramatic history of being stolen, hidden, and rescued multiple times.
The recently opened visitor's center uses augmented reality to help you explore the masterpiece's details and symbolism before you see the restored panels in person. It's an unforgettable experience for art and history lovers alike.</p>

                    <p>As the tallest belfry in Belgium and a UNESCO World Heritage site, the 91-meter-high Ghent Belfry is a powerful symbol of the city's independence and wealth.

You can climb the stairs (or take the elevator for most of the way) to the top for an unparalleled 360-degree view of Ghent. Along the way, you'll pass the impressive carillon with its 54 bells. Hearing the bells chime while looking out over the medieval rooftops is a truly memorable moment.</p>

True to its name, a lively market takes over the square every Friday morning, a tradition that has continued for hundreds of years. On Saturdays, it hosts a smaller food and flea market.

This design was influential on later cathedrals, including St. Bavo's.
Funded by Ghent's wealthy merchants and guilds, the church was a reflection of the city's prosperity. Step inside to appreciate the impressive organ and the quiet, contemplative atmosphere.

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Ghent's city center is remarkably compact and pedestrian-friendly, making walking the best way to explore the main sights. For longer distances, the city has an excellent public transport network of trams and buses run by De Lijn. A day pass or multi-day pass offers good value. Ghent is also a famous cycling city, with numerous bike rental shops available. A 'water tram' (hop-on-hop-off boat) is another scenic way to get between key locations.</p>

The Patershol neighborhood is charming and full of restaurants, while the area around the Graslei and Korenmarkt puts you right in the middle of the action. For those on a budget, the area around the main train station, Gent-Sint-Pieters, offers more affordable options and easy connections.

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Ghent is during the shoulder seasons of spring (April to June) and autumn (September to October). The weather is pleasant for walking, and the city is less crowded than in peak summer. Spring brings blooming flowers, while autumn offers beautiful foliage. Summer (July and August) is warm and lively, highlighted by the massive ten-day 'Gentse Feesten' music and theatre festival in late July, which is an incredible experience but books up far in advance. Winter is cold but magical, with Christmas markets and fewer tourists.</p>
