                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Portland has an excellent public transportation system, TriMet, which includes the MAX Light Rail, WES Commuter Rail, streetcar, and an extensive bus network. Downtown and the Pearl District are very walkable. The city is famously bike-friendly, with numerous bike lanes and the BIKETOWN bike-share program. For destinations like Washington Park or Pittock Mansion, ride-sharing services or driving may be more convenient.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>For first-time visitors, Downtown or the adjacent Pearl District offer central access to top attractions like Powell's and the waterfront, with a range of upscale and mid-range hotels (e.g., The Nines, The Hoxton). For a more boutique and charming experience, try the Alphabet District/Nob Hill (e.g., Inn at Northrup Station). To live like a local, stay on the Eastside in neighborhoods like Hawthorne or Alberta for quirky Airbnbs and smaller inns.</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Portland is during the summer (June to September) for warm, dry, and sunny weather, perfect for enjoying the city's parks and outdoor festivals. However, this is also the busiest season. Spring (April-May) is beautiful with blooming flowers, including the cherry blossoms and roses. Fall (October) offers lovely autumn colors and fewer crowds. Winter (November-March) is cool and rainy, but ideal for cozying up in coffee shops, breweries, and bookstores.</p>
