The silhouettes of the camel train against the fiery orange and purple sky create a postcard-perfect scene. The gentle, rhythmic pace of the camels allows you to soak in the vastness of the beach and the spectacular coastal colours.\n\nSeveral operators run tours, each offering a slightly different experience. It's an incredibly popular activity, so booking well in advance, especially during the peak tourist season, is essential.

When the full moon rises over the exposed tidal flats of Roebuck Bay at low tide, it creates a stunning optical illusion of a golden staircase reaching for the moon. It's a breathtaking sight that draws crowds to the shores.\n\nThe best viewing spot is Town Beach, where the monthly Staircase to the Moon Markets are held. The markets add to the festive atmosphere with local food stalls, crafts, and live music, making it a complete cultural experience.",

It's a fantastic spot for photography, especially during the golden hours of sunrise and sunset. The contrast of colours is simply stunning.\n\nAt very low tides (below 2.16m), you can clamber down the rocks to see 130-million-year-old dinosaur footprints preserved in the reef rock. For easier access, a plaster cast of the footprints is located at the top of the cliffs near the lighthouse.",

Massive tidal movements force huge volumes of water through two narrow gorges in the McLarty Range, creating a sideways waterfall effect. The only way to access this remote wonder is by seaplane and jet boat.\n\nTours offer a scenic flight over the stunning Buccaneer Archipelago, followed by a thrilling boat ride through the falls themselves. It's a high-adrenaline adventure and a spectacular way to appreciate the raw power and beauty of the Kimberley.",

Over 900 gravestones, some ornately carved from sandstone, stand in silent rows, a testament to the dangers faced by the divers, many of whom died from the bends or cyclones.\n\nWalking through the cemetery is a moving experience that offers a solemn insight into the human cost of the pearling boom.

                    <h3>Staircase to the Moon</h3>
                    <p>This incredible natural phenomenon occurs for a few nights each month between March and October. When the full moon rises over the exposed tidal flats of Roebuck Bay at low tide, it creates a stunning optical illusion of a golden staircase reaching for the moon. It's a breathtaking sight that draws crowds to the shores.

The best viewing spot is Town Beach, where the monthly Staircase to the Moon Markets are held. The markets add to the festive atmosphere with local food stalls, crafts, and live music, making it a complete cultural experience.</p>

                    <p>Described by David Attenborough as 'one of the greatest natural wonders of the world,' the Horizontal Falls are a truly unique phenomenon.

The only way to access this remote wonder is by seaplane and jet boat.

Tours offer a scenic flight over the stunning Buccaneer Archipelago, followed by a thrilling boat ride through the falls themselves. It's a high-adrenaline adventure and a spectacular way to appreciate the raw power and beauty of the Kimberley.</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The dry season (May to October) is the most popular time to visit. It features warm, dry days with clear blue skies and cooler nights, with average temperatures from 17°C to 31°C. The wet season (November to April) is characterized by high humidity, tropical downpours, and the possibility of cyclones. While some tours may not operate, it's a great time to see dramatic electrical storms, lush green landscapes, and fewer crowds.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Broome can be relatively expensive compared to major Australian cities due to its remote location.
