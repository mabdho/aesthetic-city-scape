The mosque's impressive architecture, blending modern and traditional Islamic styles, can hold up to 15,000 worshippers inside and another 10,000 in the courtyard, making it one of the largest in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe absolute highlight is climbing the minaret. After ascending over 300 steps, you are rewarded with a breathtaking 360-degree panoramic view of Kampala's seven hills, the bustling downtown, and the surrounding landscape. It's the single best vantage point in the city and provides a fantastic orientation to Kampala's layout.",

The main tomb building, Muzibu Azaala Mpanga, is a masterpiece of traditional Ganda architecture, constructed entirely from natural materials like wood, reeds, and thatch, with a massive dome-like structure.\n\nDespite a tragic fire in 2010 that destroyed the main building, extensive restoration efforts have been underway to preserve this vital piece of Buganda heritage. A visit here offers a profound insight into the history, beliefs, and spiritual traditions of the Buganda people, who form the largest ethnic group in Uganda. Guides provide detailed narratives about the kings and the kingdom's customs.",

While you can't enter the main palace building (Twekobe), the tour of the grounds provides a fascinating look into the history of the kingdom and its turbulent relationship with the central government, particularly during the 1966 crisis when it was attacked by Milton Obote's forces.\n\nA haunting and essential part of the tour is a visit to the underground prison and torture chambers built by Idi Amin. This dark, eerie network of cells, filled with water and electrified, serves as a chilling memorial to the thousands who were tortured and killed here during his brutal regime. The visit is somber but crucial for understanding a dark chapter in Uganda's history.",

This sprawling labyrinth of stalls and alleyways is where thousands of locals come to buy and sell everything imaginable, but it's most famous for its vast selection of second-hand clothing ('mivumba').\n\nA visit here is not for the faint of heart, but it's an authentic, unfiltered Kampala experience. You can find incredible bargains on clothes, shoes, electronics, and textiles. Even if you don't plan to shop, navigating the crowded passages, observing the vibrant commerce, and interacting with the resourceful vendors is an adventure in itself.

The shrine commemorates the 32 young Ugandan men (both Catholic and Anglican) who were burnt to death in 1886 on the orders of Kabaka Mwanga II for refusing to renounce their faith. The site features a stunning modern basilica, built in the shape of a traditional African hut over the spot where the Catholic martyrs were killed.\n\nThe lake on the grounds is believed by pilgrims to have healing powers. While the site is busiest on Martyrs' Day (June 3rd), when millions of pilgrims converge here, it's a moving and peaceful place to visit year-round, offering a powerful lesson in faith and sacrifice.",

While Kampala isn't directly on a sandy beach, the lakeside suburbs of Munyonyo and Ggaba offer great access. Munyonyo is more upscale, home to the Speke Resort, where you can enjoy boat cruises, horseback riding, and fine dining with lake views.\n\nGgaba is more of a local's spot, famous for its bustling fish market right on the shore. Here you can see fishermen bringing in their daily catch of tilapia and Nile perch.

                    <p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Kasubi Tombs are the sacred burial grounds for four Kabakas (Kings) of the Buganda Kingdom. The main tomb building, Muzibu Azaala Mpanga, is a masterpiece of traditional Ganda architecture, constructed entirely from natural materials like wood, reeds, and thatch, with a massive dome-like structure.

Despite a tragic fire in 2010 that destroyed the main building, extensive restoration efforts have been underway to preserve this vital piece of Buganda heritage. A visit here offers a profound insight into the history, beliefs, and spiritual traditions of the Buganda people, who form the largest ethnic group in Uganda.

                    <p>The Kabaka's Palace, also known as the Lubiri, is the historic seat of the King of the Buganda Kingdom. While you can't enter the main palace building (Twekobe), the tour of the grounds provides a fascinating look into the history of the kingdom and its turbulent relationship with the central government, particularly during the 1966 crisis when it was attacked by Milton Obote's forces.

A haunting and essential part of the tour is a visit to the underground prison and torture chambers built by Idi Amin. This dark, eerie network of cells, filled with water and electrified, serves as a chilling memorial to the thousands who were tortured and killed here during his brutal regime. The visit is somber but crucial for understanding a dark chapter in Uganda's history.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>The most common way to get around Kampala is by 'boda-boda' (motorcycle taxi), which is fast and navigates traffic easily. For safety, use ride-hailing apps like SafeBoda or Uber, which provide helmets and fixed pricing. 'Matatus' (minibus taxis) are the cheapest option and run on fixed routes, but can be crowded and confusing for new visitors. Special hire taxis are also available but are more expensive; always agree on a price beforehand.</p>

                    <p>For upscale accommodation and proximity to fine dining and nightlife, stay in Kololo or Nakasero. These areas host hotels like the Kampala Serena Hotel and the Sheraton. For beautiful views and a quieter suburban feel, consider Muyenga Hill. Budget and mid-range travelers can find excellent guesthouses and boutique hotels in areas like Bukoto and Naguru.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Kampala expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Kampala can be a very affordable city for travelers. Local transport like boda-bodas and matatus are very cheap, and a delicious local meal (like a 'rolex' or food from a local buffet) can cost just a few dollars.

Overall, it offers a wide range of options to suit any budget, from backpacker to luxury traveler.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">To get a good feel for the city and see the main highlights without rushing, 3 to 4 days is an ideal amount of time.

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Kampala safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Kampala is generally considered safe for tourists, and Ugandans are known for being incredibly warm and welcoming. However, like any large city, it's important to take common-sense precautions. Petty crime like pickpocketing and bag-snatching can occur, especially in crowded areas like markets and taxi parks. Avoid walking alone at night in unlit areas and keep your valuables secure. Traffic is a more significant safety concern; when using a boda-boda, always insist on a helmet and use a trusted service like SafeBoda.</div>
