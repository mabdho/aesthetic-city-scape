                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Wellington's central city is compact and highly walkable.

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Wellington is during the summer months (December to February) when the weather is warmest and sunniest, perfect for enjoying the waterfront and beaches. However, the shoulder seasons of spring (September to November) and autumn (March to May) are also excellent, with pleasant temperatures and fewer crowds. Be prepared for wind at any time of year—it's called 'Windy Welly' for a reason!</p>
