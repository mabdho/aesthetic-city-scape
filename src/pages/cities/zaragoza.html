Its eleven domes, adorned with vibrant blue, green, and yellow tiles, dominate the city skyline along the Ebro River. According to legend, the Virgin Mary appeared to the Apostle St. James on this spot atop a marble pillar ('pilar' in Spanish), which is now enshrined within the church. It's one of the most important pilgrimage sites in the Catholic world.\n\nInside, the sheer scale is awe-inspiring.

Originally built as a pleasure palace for a Moorish ruler in the 11th century, its 'Patio de Santa Isabel' offers serene beauty with its delicate arches and tranquil pool, rivaling Granada's Alhambra.\n\nAfter the Christian Reconquista, it was adapted by the Kings of Aragon, who added Mudéjar-style additions, including magnificent carved wooden ceilings. Later, it served as a palace for the Catholic Monarchs, a fortress, and today houses the regional parliament of Aragon. A guided tour is highly recommended to understand the rich fusion of styles and stories within its fortified walls.",

Built on the site of the former Roman forum and the city's main mosque, this cathedral is a stunning medley of architectural styles, from Romanesque foundations to a Gothic nave, a Mudéjar exterior wall (a UNESCO World Heritage site), and a Baroque tower.\n\nThe interior is just as diverse, featuring a magnificent altarpiece and beautiful chapels. Don't miss the attached Tapestry Museum, which holds one of the world's finest collections of medieval and Renaissance tapestries, with enormous and incredibly detailed pieces that are truly works of art.",

Housed in a beautifully restored 16th-century Renaissance palace, this museum provides a comprehensive look at the artist's life and work, with a particular focus on his genius as an engraver.\n\nThe museum's crown jewel is the complete collection of his four major print series: Los Caprichos, Los Desastres de la Guerra, La Tauromaquia, and Los Disparates. Seeing these powerful, often dark and satirical, works up close offers a profound insight into Goya's mind and the turbulent times he lived in.

The tradition here is to go from bar to bar, enjoying one or two specialty tapas (known as a 'tapa') and a small drink ('caña' for beer, 'vino' for wine) at each spot before moving on to the next.\n\nEach bar has its own claim to fame, from grilled mushrooms with garlic and parsley (champiñones) to crispy fried calamari (calamares) or intricate modern creations. The atmosphere is electric, especially on weekend evenings, as locals and visitors alike crowd the streets, creating a vibrant, communal dining experience that is quintessentially Spanish.",

Flanked by four bronze lions, symbols of the city, this historic bridge offers the most iconic and photogenic view of the Basílica del Pilar, perfectly reflected in the Ebro River on a calm day. It's affectionately known by locals as the 'Bridge of Lions'.\n\nA walk across the bridge is a must-do, especially at sunrise or sunset when the light casts a magical glow on the basilica's domes.

This stunning patio, belonging to the Zaporta family, was considered one of the finest examples of Aragonese Renaissance architecture. In the early 20th century, it was dismantled and sold to a French antiquarian.\n\nDecades later, Ibercaja bank bought it back, painstakingly reassembled it, and built their modern headquarters around it. Today, you can step from a contemporary bank lobby into this breathtaking, column-lined courtyard, which hosts exhibitions and events. It's a remarkable story of cultural rescue and preservation.",

                    <h3>Palacio de la Aljafería</h3>
                    <p>A journey through centuries of Aragonese history, the Aljafería Palace is the most spectacular example of Islamic architecture outside of Andalusia. Originally built as a pleasure palace for a Moorish ruler in the 11th century, its 'Patio de Santa Isabel' offers serene beauty with its delicate arches and tranquil pool, rivaling Granada's Alhambra.

After the Christian Reconquista, it was adapted by the Kings of Aragon, who added Mudéjar-style additions, including magnificent carved wooden ceilings. Later, it served as a palace for the Catholic Monarchs, a fortress, and today houses the regional parliament of Aragon. A guided tour is highly recommended to understand the rich fusion of styles and stories within its fortified walls.</p>
