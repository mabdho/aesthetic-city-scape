                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Navigating Port Moresby requires careful planning. The safest and most reliable options for tourists are hotel-arranged transport, pre-booked taxis from reputable companies, or hiring a car with a local driver. Ride-sharing apps are not prevalent. While Public Motor Vehicles (PMVs) are the most common form of local transport, they are generally not recommended for visitors due to safety concerns and overcrowding. For most attractions, arranging transport through your hotel or a tour operator is the best approach.</p>
