                    <p>A UNESCO World Heritage site, the Pampulha Modern Ensemble is a visionary project designed by legendary architect Oscar Niemeyer in the 1940s. Centered around a large artificial lake, this complex is a landmark of modern architecture.

By day, its ground floor and mezzanine are filled with traditional bookstores ('sebos') selling used books, vinyl record shops, and simple restaurants serving 'prato feito' (set lunch plates). It has a nostalgic, intellectual vibe that feels like stepping back in time.

By night, especially on the upper terrace, the atmosphere transforms. The space becomes a bustling hub of alternative bars and restaurants, popular with students, artists, and activists. It's a fantastic place to find cheap beer, interesting conversations, and a less polished, more authentic side of BH's nightlife compared to the more upscale Savassi.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Walking is feasible in central neighborhoods like Centro, Lourdes, and Savassi. For longer distances, ride-sharing apps like Uber and 99 are widely available, affordable, and generally the most convenient option for tourists. The city has an extensive bus system, which is economical but can be confusing for non-locals. The metro has only one line and is useful for specific routes, such as connecting the center to the main bus terminal (Rodoviária).</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>Savassi is the top choice for most visitors, offering a great selection of hotels, restaurants, and bars in a safe, walkable area. Lourdes is a more upscale, chic neighborhood adjacent to Savassi, known for its high-end dining. For budget travelers, the Centro (downtown) area has more affordable options but requires more caution at night. Pampulha is an option if you want to be close to the lake and stadium, but it's far from the main city buzz.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Belo Horizonte expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Belo Horizonte is generally more affordable than Brazil's main tourist hubs like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Accommodation, food, and transportation costs are noticeably lower. You can enjoy a fantastic meal at a traditional 'boteco' or a 'comida a quilo' (pay-by-weight) restaurant for a very reasonable price. While there are high-end options, it's a city where you can have a rich experience on a moderate budget.</div>
