                    <h3>Dutch Square (Red Square)</h3>
                    <p>Instantly recognizable by its striking terracotta-red colonial buildings, Dutch Square is the most iconic landmark in Malacca. The area is a photographer's dream, dominated by the Stadthuys, believed to be the oldest surviving Dutch building in the East, and Christ Church, an 18th-century Anglican church. The Queen Victoria's Fountain stands proudly in the center.

This square serves as the perfect starting point for exploring the historical core. It's a hub of activity, with colorful trishaws waiting to take you on a tour and numerous museums nearby. The vibrant red hue provides a stunning backdrop, reflecting the city's rich Dutch colonial history.</p>

                    <p>A short walk up the hill from Dutch Square leads you to the atmospheric ruins of St. Paul's Church.

The roofless structure offers a poignant glimpse into Malacca's layered past.

At the summit, you're rewarded with panoramic views of the city and the Straits of Malacca. A statue of St. Francis Xavier, who was once entombed here, stands guard at the front. It's a serene and historically significant spot, perfect for reflection and capturing beautiful photos.</p>

                    <p>One of the oldest surviving European architectural remains in Southeast Asia, A Famosa Fort was built by the Portuguese in the 16th century to defend their new territory.

The gate stands as a powerful symbol of Malacca's colonial struggles and resilience. It is a must-see historical landmark and offers a tangible connection to the city's tumultuous past, providing a stark contrast to the modern city that has grown around it.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>The compact UNESCO World Heritage core of Malacca is best explored on foot. For longer distances, 'Grab' (Malaysia's version of Uber) is the most convenient and affordable option. The iconic, brightly-decorated trishaws offer a fun, leisurely tour of the main sights.

For river views and easy access to cruises, hotels along the Malacca River like Casa del Rio are ideal. For luxury and history, The Majestic Malacca is a superb choice.
