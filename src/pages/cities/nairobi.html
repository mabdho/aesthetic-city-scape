Just a short drive from the central business district, this pristine grassland is home to a staggering array of wildlife, including four of the Big Five (lions, leopards, rhinos, and buffaloes). The park's iconic backdrop of city skyscrapers juxtaposed with grazing giraffes or a pride of lions is a photographer's dream.\n\nDriving through the park, you can spot black rhinos, which are a critically endangered species, along with zebras, wildebeests, cheetahs, and over 400 species of birds. The Ivory Burning Site Monument, where 12 tons of ivory were burnt in 1989 to protest poaching, is also a poignant stop within the park. A game drive here is an essential Nairobi activity, offering a full safari experience without leaving the city.",

                    <p>A truly unique experience, Nairobi National Park is the world's only wildlife park situated within a capital city. Just a short drive from the central business district, this pristine grassland is home to a staggering array of wildlife, including four of the Big Five (lions, leopards, rhinos, and buffaloes). The park's iconic backdrop of city skyscrapers juxtaposed with grazing giraffes or a pride of lions is a photographer's dream.

Driving through the park, you can spot black rhinos, which are a critically endangered species, along with zebras, wildebeests, cheetahs, and over 400 species of birds. The Ivory Burning Site Monument, where 12 tons of ivory were burnt in 1989 to protest poaching, is also a poignant stop within the park. A game drive here is an essential Nairobi activity, offering a full safari experience without leaving the city.</p>

It serves as a place of remembrance and reflection, offering a quiet escape from the noise of the surrounding city center. The park features a memorial wall inscribed with the names of all who perished in the attack.

The beautifully landscaped gardens, fountains, and sculptures promote a message of peace and reconciliation. There is also a small museum that documents the events of that tragic day and its aftermath. It is a poignant and important site that honors a key moment in Nairobi's recent history.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Nairobi offers several transportation options. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Bolt are popular, affordable, and generally safe for getting around the city. Local taxis are also available but agree on a fare before starting your trip. For a local experience, you can use 'matatus' (privately owned minibuses) which run on fixed routes and are very cheap, though they can be crowded and drive erratically. 'Boda-bodas' (motorcycle taxis) are quick for short distances but carry higher risks; always insist on a helmet.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>Westlands is a vibrant hub with upscale hotels, restaurants, and nightlife. Kilimani is a popular residential area with many mid-range hotels, apartments, and cafes. For a more tranquil and luxurious stay, Karen offers boutique hotels and guesthouses set in leafy suburbs, close to many attractions. The Central Business District (CBD) has business hotels and is convenient for museums but can be deserted at night. Recommended hotels include Villa Rosa Kempinski (Luxury), Tribe Hotel (Luxury), The Social House (Mid-Range), and Wildebeest Eco Camp (Budget).</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Nairobi is during its two dry seasons: from June to October and from January to February. During these months, the weather is sunny and pleasant, with cooler temperatures, making it ideal for wildlife viewing in Nairobi National Park as animals gather around water sources. The long rains occur from March to May, and the short rains from November to December. While you can still visit during the rainy seasons, game drives can be challenging on muddy tracks.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Nairobi expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Nairobi's cost can vary widely.

                    <div class="faq-question">How many days do you need in Nairobi?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Three to four days are ideal for a first-time visitor. This allows enough time to cover the major attractions like Nairobi National Park, the Sheldrick Trust, the Giraffe Centre, and key museums without feeling rushed.

If you plan to use Nairobi as a base for day trips, like to Lake Naivasha or Kiambethu Tea Farm, consider adding an extra day or two.</div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Nairobi safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Nairobi has a reputation for crime, and like any major city, requires vigilance. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and snatch-and-grab theft, can occur, especially in crowded areas like the CBD and markets. It's advisable to avoid walking alone at night, especially in unlit areas. Do not display expensive items like cameras and jewelry openly. Use reputable transport options like Uber, Bolt, or hotel-arranged taxis instead of hailing cabs off the street. By being sensible and aware of your surroundings, most visitors have a trouble-free experience.</div>
