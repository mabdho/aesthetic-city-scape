                    <p>Fukuoka's yatai, or open-air food stalls, are an iconic part of the city's identity.

They offer a unique dining experience where you can chat with the chef and fellow diners while enjoying delicious, affordable food.

Grabbing a seat at a yatai is not just about the food; it's about soaking in the lively atmosphere and experiencing Fukuoka's warm hospitality firsthand.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Fukuoka boasts an excellent public transport system. The subway is the most convenient way to travel between major areas like the airport, Hakata Station, and Tenjin, with three lines (Kuko, Hakozaki, Nanakuma). For destinations not on the subway lines, the Nishitetsu bus network is extensive and efficient. The Fukuoka Tourist City Pass offers unlimited rides on buses and subways for a day. Central areas like Tenjin and Hakata are very walkable.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>For first-time visitors, staying in Hakata is ideal for its proximity to the main shinkansen station and airport access. Tenjin is the city's downtown core, perfect for those who want to be in the heart of the shopping, dining, and nightlife scene. For a trendier, more boutique experience, the Daimyo area next to Tenjin is packed with chic cafes and independent shops. Recommended hotels include Hotel Nikko Fukuoka (luxury), The Blossom Hakata Premier (mid-range), and WeBase Hakata (budget/hostel).</p>
