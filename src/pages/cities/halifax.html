                    <h3>Peggy's Cove</h3>
                    <p>Just an hour's drive from Halifax, Peggy's Cove is an iconic Canadian landmark and a quintessential Nova Scotian fishing village. The village is famous for its picturesque lighthouse perched on a massive granite outcrop, pounded by the Atlantic waves. It's one of the most photographed lighthouses in the world, and for good reason. Visitors can explore the charming village, with its colourful fishing shacks and art galleries, and watch fishing boats come and go.

While the rugged beauty is undeniable, visitors must exercise extreme caution on the rocks, as rogue waves are a real danger. The stark, windswept landscape offers a powerful glimpse into the raw power of the Atlantic and the resilience of coastal communities. It's a day trip that provides an unforgettable taste of Nova Scotia's coastline.</p>
