                    <p>Rundle Mall is Adelaide's premier pedestrian shopping precinct and the vibrant commercial hub of the city. Stretching between King William Street and Pulteney Street, it's home to major department stores, international brands, local boutiques, and several charming arcades, like the historic Adelaide Arcade.

Be sure to take a photo with the mall's famous sculptures: a group of four life-sized bronze pigs named Truffles, Horatio, Oliver, and Augusta, and the iconic 'Spheres' sculpture, colloquially known as the 'Mall's Balls'. Whether you're in the mood for serious retail therapy or just want to soak up the city's daily life, Rundle Mall is the place to be.</p>
