The Daintree Rainforest is a living museum, home to ancient flora and unique wildlife, including the elusive cassowary. A day trip or overnight stay allows you to venture north of Cairns, crossing the Daintree River by ferry into a world of dense jungle canopies and pristine beaches.\n\nAt Cape Tribulation, the rainforest dramatically meets the reef—the only place in the world where two World Heritage sites sit side-by-side. Take a guided rainforest walk, cruise a river looking for crocodiles, taste exotic tropical fruits at a local farm, or simply relax on the secluded sands of Myall Beach.",

This spectacular ride winds its way from Cairns up the Macalister Range to the charming rainforest village of Kuranda. The railway, an engineering feat completed in 1891, carves through dense rainforest, past breathtaking waterfalls like Barron Falls, and over 40 bridges and through 15 hand-carved tunnels.\n\nThe journey itself is the attraction, offering stunning views from restored vintage carriages. Upon arrival in Kuranda, you can explore the village's markets, wildlife sanctuaries, and walking tracks before returning, perhaps via the Skyrail Rainforest Cableway for a different perspective.",

The Skyrail Rainforest Cableway provides a unique and immersive perspective of the jungle below. The journey includes two mid-stations, Red Peak and Barron Falls, where you can alight and explore the forest floor via boardwalks, visit interpretive centres, and take in spectacular views from lookouts.\n\nThe Barron Falls station offers incredible vistas of the majestic gorge and falls, especially powerful during the wet season. Combining the Skyrail with the Kuranda Scenic Railway is the most popular way to experience both, creating a full-day rainforest adventure.",

With sandy shores, timber decking for sunbathing, and lifeguards on duty, it's a perfect spot for families, backpackers, and locals to relax and escape the tropical heat. As swimming in the ocean near the city is not advised due to crocodiles and stingers, this is the go-to swimming spot.\n\nSurrounded by grassy lawns, free public barbecues, and children's playgrounds, the lagoon area is a vibrant community hub. It's particularly beautiful at sunrise and sunset, with stunning views across the Trinity Inlet.",

Covered in lush rainforest and fringed by coral beaches and turquoise waters, it's a more rugged and adventurous alternative to Green Island. The island is part of a National Park, offering a wealth of activities.\n\nSnorkel straight off the beach at Welcome Bay and Nudey Beach (consistently voted one of Australia's best beaches), rent a kayak or stand-up paddleboard, or hike the Lighthouse Trail for panoramic views. The island is also home to the Cairns Turtle Rehabilitation Centre, where you can take a tour to learn about their conservation efforts.",

This 'food bowl' of the tropics is perfect for a self-drive tour, where you can sample local coffee, cheese, chocolate, and tropical fruits directly from the producers.\n\nHighlights include swimming in the volcanic crater lakes of Lake Eacham and Lake Barrine, marveling at the enormous Curtain Fig Tree, and chasing waterfalls along the 'Waterfall Circuit,' which includes the famous Millaa Millaa Falls. The cooler climate and diverse landscapes provide a beautiful contrast to the coastal region.",

The Mossman Gorge Centre is the gateway, where you take a shuttle bus into the heart of the gorge. Here, crystal-clear water from the Mossman River tumbles over giant granite boulders, surrounded by lush rainforest.\n\nA key experience is the Ngadiku Dreamtime Walk, a guided tour led by local Indigenous people. They share their deep connection to the land, demonstrating traditional plant uses, identifying bush food sources, and telling legendary stories. It's a culturally rich and visually stunning experience.",

It's unique for being the only coral cay on the reef with a rainforest growing on it. Just a 45-minute catamaran ride from Cairns, it's an incredibly popular and family-friendly day trip.\n\nActivities include snorkeling directly from the beach, taking a glass-bottom boat tour to see the coral and marine life without getting wet, or exploring the island's lush interior on a short walking track. You can even visit Marineland Melanesia to see crocodiles and marine artifacts. It's an easy, all-in-one reef and island experience.",

It's a perfect rainy-day activity and provides great context for what you'll see on a reef or rainforest tour.",

A short 700-meter walk through the rainforest leads you to viewing platforms and the main swimming area.\n\nThe highlight for many is the natural rockslide, a smooth, sloping rock face that visitors can slide down into the refreshing pool below. It's a stunningly beautiful spot to spend an afternoon swimming and relaxing. Always obey safety signs, as water levels can rise rapidly after rain.",

In the 1930s, Spanish immigrant José Paronella built a Spanish-style castle, picnic area, tennis courts, and a ballroom on 5 hectares of lush rainforest next to Mena Creek Falls. Today, the moss-covered ruins evoke a sense of fantasy and romance.\n\nYour entry ticket is valid for 24 months and includes a guided walk explaining the park's incredible history, as well as an evening tour to see the castle and falls illuminated. It’s a magical, slightly surreal experience that tells a story of ambition, love, and perseverance against the odds.",

The main swimming area is safe and family-friendly, surrounded by lush rainforest.\n\nDownstream lies the Devil's Pool, an area of cultural significance to the local Indigenous people and subject to a tragic legend. While the lookout is beautiful, swimming is strictly forbidden here due to dangerously fast currents. Stick to the main picnic and swimming area for a safe and refreshing dip in a gorgeous natural setting.",

                    <h3>Daintree Rainforest & Cape Tribulation</h3>
                    <p>Explore the oldest continuously surviving tropical rainforest on the planet. The Daintree Rainforest is a living museum, home to ancient flora and unique wildlife, including the elusive cassowary. A day trip or overnight stay allows you to venture north of Cairns, crossing the Daintree River by ferry into a world of dense jungle canopies and pristine beaches.

At Cape Tribulation, the rainforest dramatically meets the reef—the only place in the world where two World Heritage sites sit side-by-side. Take a guided rainforest walk, cruise a river looking for crocodiles, taste exotic tropical fruits at a local farm, or simply relax on the secluded sands of Myall Beach.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Cairns city center is compact and walkable. For longer distances, the 'Sunbus' public bus network connects the city to the Northern Beaches. Taxis and rideshare services like Uber and Didi are widely available. Renting a car is the best option for exploring further afield, such as the Atherton Tablelands or Port Douglas. Many tours include coach transfers from your accommodation.</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Cairns is during the dry season, from May to October. During these months, you can expect warm temperatures, lower humidity, and plenty of sunshine, making it ideal for reef and rainforest exploration. The wet season (November to April) is characterized by high humidity, tropical downpours, and the possibility of cyclones. It's also 'stinger season', requiring protective suits for swimming in the ocean.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Cairns expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cairns can be as expensive or as affordable as you make it. The main costs are tours to the Great Barrier Reef and Daintree Rainforest, which are significant but essential experiences. Accommodation ranges from budget-friendly hostels to luxury resorts. Food and drink prices are comparable to other major Australian cities, but you can save money by using public BBQs and eating at food courts. Overall, it's generally considered more affordable than Sydney or Melbourne, but budgeting for major tours is crucial.</div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How many days do you need in Cairns?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">A minimum of 3 full days is recommended to experience the two main highlights: one day for the Great Barrier Reef and one day for the rainforest (Daintree or Kuranda). However, to truly appreciate the region without feeling rushed, 5 to 7 days is ideal. This allows for extra time to explore the Atherton Tablelands, relax on an island like Fitzroy, and enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of Cairns itself.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Cairns safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cairns is generally a safe city for tourists. Standard precautions against petty crime, like not leaving valuables unattended, should be taken. The main safety concerns are environmental. Always swim between the flags at patrolled beaches and at the Esplanade Lagoon. During stinger season (typically Nov-May), wear a protective lycra suit in the ocean. Be 'croc-wise' near rivers and estuaries—obey all warning signs and never swim in un-signposted waterways. Sun protection is vital year-round.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What is Cairns famous for?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cairns is world-famous for being the primary gateway to two UNESCO World Heritage sites: the Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree Rainforest. Its identity is inextricably linked to these natural wonders. The city is also known for its vibrant, tropical, and laid-back atmosphere, its adventure tourism (bungee jumping, white water rafting), and its role as a major hub for backpackers and international travelers exploring Australia's east coast.</div>
