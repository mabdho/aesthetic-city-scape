      "description": "For the adventurous, a trip to Mount Merapi, one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, is a must. The most popular activity is the sunrise jeep tour. You'll ride in a classic Willis Jeep through rugged terrain, passing villages devastated by the last major eruption in 2010. The tour includes stops at a small museum with eruption artifacts and a 'bunker' with a tragic story.\n\nThe highlight is reaching a viewpoint just before dawn to watch the sunrise over the volcanic landscape. The raw power and beauty of the volcano, often seen with smoke gently rising from its crater, make for an awe-inspiring and humbling experience.",

The experience begins with being lowered 60 meters into the sinkhole by a team of specialists using ropes and harnesses.\n\nAfter reaching the bottom, you'll trek through a muddy tunnel to reach the main chamber where the light shines through, typically between 10 AM and 12 PM. It's a challenging but incredibly rewarding journey that offers unparalleled photo opportunities and a sense of discovery.",

Both options provide a heart-stopping ride and incredible views. The journey to the beach itself is part of the adventure, requiring a 4x4 jeep ride over rough, unpaved roads.

By day, it's packed with shops and stalls selling everything from batik shirts and leather goods to souvenirs and local snacks. By night, it transforms into a massive open-air food court, with countless 'lesehan' (mat-seating) food stalls setting up along the pavement.\n\nStrolling down Malioboro is an essential Jogja experience. Soak in the chaotic energy, haggle for a bargain, try local delicacies like 'gudeg' or 'kopi joss' (coffee with a hot charcoal), and watch the city come alive. It's the perfect place to feel the urban pulse of Yogyakarta.",

      "description": "Often overlooked in favor of its grand neighbor Prambanan, Plaosan Temple is a hidden gem that is well worth a visit. This 9th-century Buddhist temple complex is actually composed of two main temples, Plaosan Lor (North) and Plaosan Kidul (South). The temples are beautifully adorned with intricate carvings and statues of Bodhisattvas.\n\nWhat makes Plaosan unique is the blend of Buddhist and Hindu architectural elements, believed to symbolize the union of a Hindu prince and a Buddhist princess. The complex is surrounded by serene rice paddies, making it incredibly picturesque and far less crowded than the major temples. It offers a peaceful and intimate glimpse into Java's ancient past.",

      "description": "For a uniquely Javanese evening, head to Alun-Alun Kidul, the southern square behind the Kraton. By day, it's a sleepy field with two large banyan trees at its center. By night, it transforms into a carnival-like atmosphere, filled with locals and tourists alike. The main attraction is renting a 'becak hias' or 'odong-odong' – wildly decorated, neon-lit pedal cars, often blasting loud music.\n\nAnother famous activity is the 'masangin' challenge: attempting to walk blindfolded between the two central banyan trees. Legend says that those pure of heart will succeed, and their wish will be granted. It's a fun, quirky, and memorable way to spend an evening in Jogja.",

                    <p>Another UNESCO World Heritage site, Prambanan is a stunning collection of massive Hindu temples dedicated to the Trimurti: Brahma (the Creator), Vishnu (the Preserver), and Shiva (the Destroyer). Built in the 9th century, this complex is characterized by its tall, pointed architecture, with the central Shiva temple soaring to an impressive 47 meters.

The intricate carvings covering the temples tell the epic Hindu story of the Ramayana. Exploring the sprawling grounds and discovering the smaller surrounding temples is a delight. For a truly magical evening, catch the Ramayana Ballet performance with the illuminated temples as a dramatic backdrop.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Yogyakarta is easy to navigate. Ride-hailing apps like Grab and Gojek are incredibly cheap and convenient for both cars and motorcycle taxis ('ojek'). For a traditional experience, try a 'becak' (cycle rickshaw) for short distances (agree on the price beforehand). The TransJogja bus system is an affordable way to reach major sites like Prambanan. For ultimate freedom, renting a scooter is a popular option, or you can hire a private car with a driver for a full day of sightseeing, which is very affordable.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">What is Yogyakarta famous for?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yogyakarta is famous for being the cultural and artistic soul of Java. It's primarily known for its proximity to the world-renowned UNESCO World Heritage sites, Borobudur (Buddhist) and Prambanan (Hindu) temples. It is also famous for traditional Javanese arts like batik textiles, silver craftsmanship (in Kota Gede), gamelan music, and wayang kulit (shadow puppetry). As a royal city still headed by a Sultan, its deep-rooted Javanese court culture is a major draw.</div>
