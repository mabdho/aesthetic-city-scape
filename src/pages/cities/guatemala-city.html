The pillars in front of the cathedral bear the names of thousands of people who were 'disappeared' or killed during the Guatemalan Civil War.\n\nInside, you'll find a serene atmosphere with beautiful colonial art, ornate altars, and a network of catacombs beneath the main floor.

Although much of the area has been covered by urban sprawl, the protected park contains several restored mounds and plazas.\n\nThe on-site museum offers context, but the real experience is walking among the grassy mounds that hide ancient temples and tombs. It's a quiet, contemplative space that provides a stark contrast to the surrounding urban chaos and highlights the deep historical layers of the valley.",

                    <h3>Catedral Metropolitana</h3>
                    <p>Facing the National Palace across the Plaza de la Constitución, the Metropolitan Cathedral has been a silent witness to Guatemala's turbulent history. Its full name is Catedral Primada Metropolitana de Santiago. Built between 1782 and 1815, its neoclassical façade has survived numerous earthquakes, which have damaged and destroyed previous structures on the site. The pillars in front of the cathedral bear the names of thousands of people who were 'disappeared' or killed during the Guatemalan Civil War.

Inside, you'll find a serene atmosphere with beautiful colonial art, ornate altars, and a network of catacombs beneath the main floor. It's a place for quiet reflection and a poignant reminder of the nation's resilience.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Getting around Guatemala City requires some planning. For tourists, the safest and most convenient options are ride-sharing apps like Uber or licensed taxis (ask your hotel to call one). The public bus system, Transmetro, is modern and efficient but serves specific routes and can be crowded. It's best used for direct routes, like getting to the historic center. Walking is feasible within specific zones like Zona 1 (during the day) or parts of Zona 10, but not recommended between zones due to distance and safety concerns.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>Zona 10 (Zona Viva) is the most popular choice for tourists, offering upscale hotels, international restaurants, and a safe environment. Zona 4 (4 Grados Norte) is a trendier, bohemian option with boutique hotels, craft breweries, and a vibrant nightlife. Zona 1 (Historic Center) offers budget-friendly hotels and hostels close to the main historical sites but requires more caution, especially at night. For a modern, resort-like feel, the area around Paseo Cayalá in Zona 16 offers high-end apartments and hotels.</p>

                    <p>Guatemala is known as the 'Land of Eternal Spring' for its temperate climate year-round. The best time to visit is during the dry season, which runs from November to April.

While still a good time to visit, be prepared for rain.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Guatemala City safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Guatemala City has a reputation for being unsafe, and it's important to be cautious. However, tourist-frequented zones like Zona 10 (Zona Viva), Zona 14, Zona 16 (Cayalá), and Zona 4 are generally safe, especially during the day. Zona 1 (Historic Center) is safe during daylight hours but should be avoided at night. It is crucial to avoid certain zones entirely (e.g., Zona 3, 6, 18, 21). Use reputable transportation like Uber or hotel taxis instead of hailing street cabs, avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics, and always be aware of your surroundings. With common-sense precautions, a visit can be safe and rewarding.</div>
