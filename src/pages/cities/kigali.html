The main exhibit guides visitors through the historical context leading up to the genocide, the horrific events themselves, and the ongoing process of reconciliation and rebuilding. It is a powerful, somber, and impeccably curated institution that provides crucial context for understanding modern Rwanda.\n\nBeyond the main exhibits, the memorial includes gardens for quiet reflection, mass graves where over 250,000 victims are interred, and a children's memorial. While emotionally challenging, a visit here is fundamental to appreciating the resilience and progress of the nation. It is a place of remembrance, education, and a testament to the enduring human spirit.",

This museum focuses on the military story of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) and their campaign to stop the genocide and liberate the country. The exhibits detail the strategic decisions and heroic actions taken during the 100-day conflict.\n\nThe building itself is historically significant, as it was a key RPF stronghold during the war and still bears the scars of bullets and shelling.

The Kandt House Museum offers a fascinating look at Rwanda's history during the German and Belgian colonial periods. The exhibits present life before, during, and after colonization.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling part of the museum is the annex dedicated to Rwanda's natural history.

The journey up winds through charming rural communities, offering a glimpse of life on the city's outskirts. Once at the summit, you're rewarded with breathtaking 360-degree views of Kigali's sprawling hills and valleys.\n\nAt the top, you'll find Fazenda Sengha, an equestrian center offering horseback riding trails with incredible vistas. There's also a casual restaurant and bar, making it a perfect spot to watch the sunset over the city with a cold drink in hand.

During the genocide, its manager, Paul Rusesabagina, sheltered over 1,200 people within its walls. Today, it operates as a luxury hotel, but visitors are welcome to visit its common areas.\n\nYou can have a drink at the poolside bar or dinner at the panoramic restaurant, reflecting on the history that unfolded here. While it has been fully renovated, the atmosphere remains poignant. It stands as a symbol of both immense bravery and the horrors of the past, offering a tangible connection to one of the most well-known stories of the genocide.",

The museum showcases a collection of contemporary art from both Rwandan and international artists. The pieces rotate, providing a fresh perspective on the creative landscape of the region.\n\nHowever, a major draw is the building itself. This was the home of President Juvénal Habyarimana, whose plane crash on April 6, 1994, was a key trigger for the genocide. Visitors can tour the palace and even see the debris from the plane crash, which still lies in the garden. It's a surreal and fascinating site that provides another layer to understanding Rwanda's complex history.",

The soldiers were captured while protecting the Prime Minister, and their deaths led to the withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping force, leaving Rwandan civilians unprotected.\n\nThe memorial consists of a small, bullet-scarred building where the soldiers made their last stand. Outside, ten stone pillars stand in a solemn line, one for each soldier, with horizontal lines carved into them to mark their age. It is a simple, poignant, and often overlooked site that powerfully conveys the international failure during the genocide's early days.",

Located on a restored wetland on the edge of Kigali, the village provides a safe home for over 50 cranes that have been rescued from illegal captivity. These majestic birds, unable to be released back into the wild, now roam freely in a stunning natural habitat.\n\nA visit involves a peaceful walk along well-maintained paths and boardwalks that meander through the marshland.
