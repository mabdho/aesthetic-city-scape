Located in the heart of the Upper Town in St. Mark's Square, the church's roof beautifully displays the medieval coat of arms of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia on the left, and the emblem of the city of Zagreb on the right.\n\nThe church itself dates back to the 13th century, with a Gothic portal that is considered the most valuable in Southern Europe. While the interior is often closed to tourists except during mass, the exterior alone is worth the visit. The square is also home to the Croatian Parliament and the Government Palace, making it the political center of the country.",

This award-winning museum showcases a collection of personal objects, each accompanied by a brief story, donated by anonymous people from around the globe. The items represent the remnants of past relationships, ranging from humorous and quirky to deeply touching and heartbreaking.\n\nIt’s a powerful exploration of love, loss, and the human condition.

Its most iconic feature is the sea of red umbrellas shading the outdoor stalls, where local farmers sell fresh fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Below, in the covered section, you'll find butchers, fishmongers, and vendors selling homemade cheese, honey, pasta, and other local delicacies.\n\nIt's the perfect place to experience local life, sample fresh produce, and pick up authentic Croatian products. The energy is infectious, and it offers a genuine taste of Zagreb's daily culture. Be sure to try some 'sir i vrhnje' (cottage cheese and cream), a local specialty.",

It feels like stepping back in time. This is where you'll find many of the city's key landmarks, including St. Mark's Church, the Croatian Parliament, the Museum of Broken Relationships, and Lotrščak Tower.\n\nWandering through its quiet alleys and picturesque squares is an attraction in itself. You can reach the Upper Town by a steep walk or by taking the historic Zagreb Funicular. The views over the Lower Town and the Cathedral from the Strossmayer Promenade are simply breathtaking, especially at sunset.",

With a track length of only 66 meters, the ride takes just 64 seconds. Despite its short duration, it's a beloved city icon and a charming way to avoid the steep climb on foot.\n\nIn operation since 1890, it has retained its original appearance and construction, making it the oldest form of public transport in Zagreb. Taking a ride offers a quaint, nostalgic experience and saves you a bit of energy for exploring the historic Upper Town.",

Opened in 1794, it was one of the first public parks in southeast Europe. It features vast meadows, dense oak forests, five lakes, and several charming 19th-century structures like the Echo Pavilion and the Bellevue Belvedere.\n\nNestled within the park is the Zagreb Zoo, home to hundreds of animal species, including snow leopards, red pandas, and okapis. The combination of the beautifully landscaped English-style park and the well-maintained zoo makes it an ideal destination for families, nature lovers, or anyone looking to escape the city bustle.",

Considered one of the most beautiful cemeteries in Europe, it's more like an open-air art gallery and park. Designed by the famed architect Hermann Bollé, its majestic arcades, cupolas, and lush greenery create a serene and monumental atmosphere.\n\nMirogoj is the final resting place for many of Croatia's most famous figures, and it's notable for being an interdenominational cemetery where Catholic, Orthodox, Muslim, and Jewish graves lie side by side. A walk along its ivy-covered walls and grand arcades is a peaceful and unexpectedly beautiful experience.",

This fortified tower dates back to the 13th century and was built to guard the southern gate of the Gradec town wall. The climb to the top is rewarded with stunning 360-degree views of the entire city, including the Cathedral, St. Mark's Church, and the sprawling Lower Town.\n\nBe prepared for a daily tradition: every day at noon, the Grič Cannon is fired from one of the tower's windows. This tradition, dating back to 1877, was intended to signal the city's bell-ringers. The loud boom reverberates across the city and is a beloved local quirk. Arrive just before noon to witness it up close (but cover your ears!).",

Designed by Viennese architects Fellner and Helmer and opened in 1895 by Emperor Franz Joseph I, this magnificent neo-baroque building is a sight to behold. Its striking yellow facade and ornate interiors host world-class opera, ballet, and drama performances.\n\nEven if you don't catch a show, it's worth walking around the building to admire its architecture and the beautiful square it sits on, which features Ivan Meštrović's sculpture 'The Well of Life'. For a truly memorable evening, consider booking a ticket for a performance—they are surprisingly affordable.",

By day, it's a popular spot for a leisurely coffee, while at night it transforms into the city's main hub for dining and nightlife.\n\nThe street follows the path of the former Medveščak stream, which once divided the rival settlements of Kaptol and Gradec. Today, it unites them as a place for relaxation and fun. A stroll down Tkalčićeva is essential for soaking up Zagreb's lively atmosphere and enjoying its famous café culture.",

According to legend, a great fire in 1731 destroyed everything except for a painting of the Virgin and Child, which was found intact in the ashes. A chapel was built within the arch of the gate to house the miraculous painting, and it remains there to this day.\n\nYou'll often find locals stopping to light a candle and say a quiet prayer, making it a place of deep spiritual significance. The stone walls are covered in plaques thanking the Virgin for answered prayers. It’s a peaceful, moving place that offers a glimpse into the city's soul.",

Unlike traditional museums where exhibits are behind glass, here you are encouraged to touch everything. You can sit on the sofa, play video games on a vintage computer, try on clothes, and even flick through old magazines.\n\nIt’s a fun, colorful, and highly immersive experience that provides insight into the culture and lifestyle of Zagreb during a unique period of its history. It's a fantastic alternative to more traditional museums and is particularly enjoyable for families or anyone with an interest in recent history and pop culture.",

It is home to over 10,000 plant species from Croatia and around the world, arranged in beautifully landscaped sections including an English-style arboretum, flowerbeds, and greenhouses with tropical and subtropical plants.\n\nIt’s the perfect place for a peaceful stroll, offering a quiet respite from the city's energy. The picturesque ponds with turtles, wooden bridges, and shaded benches make it a favorite spot for both locals and tourists to relax and connect with nature.",

                    <p>Instantly recognizable by its vibrant, tiled roof, St. Mark's Church is one of Zagreb's most emblematic buildings. Located in the heart of the Upper Town in St. Mark's Square, the church's roof beautifully displays the medieval coat of arms of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia on the left, and the emblem of the city of Zagreb on the right.

The church itself dates back to the 13th century, with a Gothic portal that is considered the most valuable in Southern Europe. While the interior is often closed to tourists except during mass, the exterior alone is worth the visit. The square is also home to the Croatian Parliament and the Government Palace, making it the political center of the country.</p>

The climb to the top is rewarded with stunning 360-degree views of the entire city, including the Cathedral, St. Mark's Church, and the sprawling Lower Town.

Be prepared for a daily tradition: every day at noon, the Grič Cannon is fired from one of the tower's windows. This tradition, dating back to 1877, was intended to signal the city's bell-ringers. The loud boom reverberates across the city and is a beloved local quirk. Arrive just before noon to witness it up close (but cover your ears!).</p>

You'll often find locals stopping to light a candle and say a quiet prayer, making it a place of deep spiritual significance. The stone walls are covered in plaques thanking the Virgin for answered prayers. It’s a peaceful, moving place that offers a glimpse into the city's soul.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Zagreb is a very walkable city, especially the historic center. For longer distances, the efficient and affordable ZET tram system is excellent. Trams are the primary mode of public transport and cover the entire city. Single tickets can be bought at newspaper kiosks (called 'tisak') or from the driver. Ride-sharing services like Uber and Bolt are also widely available and reasonably priced.</p>
