Spanning four city blocks, this landmark is one of the nation's oldest public markets. While it once sold produce and provisions, today it's a bustling marketplace filled with local vendors selling everything from artisanal foods and crafts to souvenirs. The market is particularly famous for its 'basket ladies,' Gullah artisans who weave intricate sweetgrass baskets, a craft passed down through generations from their West African ancestors.\n\nWalking through the open-air sheds, you'll feel the city's living history. It's a fantastic place to find unique, locally made gifts and get a literal taste of Charleston.

These Georgian-style houses are a signature of the city's charming aesthetic. The story behind the colors varies, with legends suggesting they were painted to help drunken sailors find their way home or to keep the houses cool in the summer heat.\n\nWhile you cannot enter the private residences, the real magic is in the exterior view. A stroll along this street offers a perfect photo opportunity and a glimpse into Charleston's unique architectural preservation. The best light for photography is typically in the morning. It's a quintessential Charleston experience that perfectly captures the city's vibrant personality.",

Located on an island in Charleston Harbor, the fort is only accessible by a scenic ferry ride, which itself provides stunning views of the city, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, and the coastline.\n\nOnce on the island, National Park Rangers provide insightful talks about the fort's history and the events that led to the war. You can explore the remaining fortifications and visit the on-site museum. The entire experience is a powerful and sobering reminder of a pivotal moment in American history.",

Created in 1741, these stunning gardens reflect the grand classical style of the era, with terraced lawns, symmetrical designs, and serene reflection pools. A visit feels like stepping into a European estate, but with a distinct Lowcountry atmosphere.\n\nBeyond the gardens, the property includes a House Museum, which offers a glimpse into the lives of the Middleton family, who played significant roles in American history. The plantation also includes stableyards with heritage breed animals and craftspeople demonstrating 18th-century skills.

They burst with color year-round, especially in the spring with thousands of azaleas and camellias in bloom.\n\nBeyond the stunning gardens, visitors can take a house tour, a nature tram tour through the property's wetlands and marshes, or a boat tour on the Ashley River. The 'From Slavery to Freedom' tour offers critical insight into the lives of the enslaved people who were essential to the plantation's existence.
