The high-speed catamarans of Aremiti and Terevau whisk you across the Sea of the Moon in just 30-45 minutes, offering breathtaking views of Moorea's jagged volcanic peaks as you approach. \n\nOnce on Moorea, you can rent a car or scooter to explore its lush valleys, pineapple plantations, and turquoise bays.

This is where Captain James Cook observed the transit of Venus in 1769, and where the first missionaries from the London Missionary Society landed in 1797. A tall, white lighthouse, the only one in Tahiti, has stood guard here since 1867. \n\nThe area features a monument to Captain Cook and another to the missionaries. It's also home to a beautiful black-sand beach, popular with local families for swimming and picnicking.

Located on the east coast, about a 45-minute drive from Papeete, this site offers an easily accessible rainforest experience. \n\nA short, flat walk from the parking lot takes you to the first and most impressive waterfall, Vaimahutu. Two other cascades, Haamaremare Rahi and Haamaremare Iti, can be reached via a slightly more challenging 20-minute trail. It's a refreshing and picturesque spot, perfect for cooling off and capturing beautiful photos of Tahiti's natural splendor.",

Located on the west coast, it's considered one of the island's best public beaches. The sand is white and soft, and the calm, clear lagoon is perfect for swimming and snorkeling. \n\nThere's a designated snorkeling area with decent coral and abundant fish, making it great for families and beginners. The beach has public restrooms and showers, and on weekends, you'll find food trucks selling snacks and drinks. It's the perfect place to spend a relaxing afternoon enjoying the sun and sea.",

As Tahiti's third-highest peak, it offers some of the most spectacular and dramatic views on the island. The trail is demanding, often muddy, and involves narrow ridges, so it's not for the faint of heart. \n\nThe full hike to the summit is typically done over two days, with an overnight stay in a basic shelter. However, a shorter day hike to the first shelter (a 4-5 hour round trip) still provides incredible panoramic views of Papeete, the lagoon, and Moorea. This trek offers a powerful connection to Tahiti's wild, untamed interior.",

It's a pleasant spot to rest your feet after exploring the nearby shops and waterfront. \n\nThe park features two large cannons salvaged from the Seeadler, a German schooner scuttled in the Tuamotu Archipelago during WWI, and a bronze statue of Bougainville. The giant Banyan trees provide ample shade, and a small stream runs through the grounds, creating a peaceful ambiance right next to the busy downtown streets.",

Located in Arue, just east of Papeete, the tomb is notable for its construction. It was originally intended to be the Queen Mother's water cistern, but was repurposed upon the king's death in 1891. \n\nThe tomb is constructed from coral blocks and is topped with what looks like a red Greek urn, which some say is a nod to the king's notorious love for French spirits like Benedictine. It's a quick but interesting stop that offers a glimpse into the end of Tahiti's royal era and the transition to French rule.",

The pareu is a brightly colored sarong, an incredibly versatile piece of clothing that can be tied in dozens of ways. You'll find them everywhere, from high-end boutiques to the bustling stalls of the Papeete Market. \n\nMonoi oil is a fragrant, infused perfume oil made from soaking the petals of Tahitian gardenias (tiare flowers) in coconut oil. It's used for moisturizing skin and hair and is a signature scent of the islands. Exploring the different shops, smelling the various scents of monoi, and choosing a vibrant pareu is a cultural activity in itself and provides the perfect authentic souvenir.",

As Tahiti's third-highest peak, it offers some of the most spectacular and dramatic views on the island. The trail is demanding, often muddy, and involves narrow ridges, so it's not for the faint of heart. 

The full hike to the summit is typically done over two days, with an overnight stay in a basic shelter. However, a shorter day hike to the first shelter (a 4-5 hour round trip) still provides incredible panoramic views of Papeete, the lagoon, and Moorea.

                    <p>Visit a unique and slightly unusual historical site at the Tomb of King Pōmare V, the last king of Tahiti. Located in Arue, just east of Papeete, the tomb is notable for its construction. It was originally intended to be the Queen Mother's water cistern, but was repurposed upon the king's death in 1891. 

The tomb is constructed from coral blocks and is topped with what looks like a red Greek urn, which some say is a nod to the king's notorious love for French spirits like Benedictine. It's a quick but interesting stop that offers a glimpse into the end of Tahiti's royal era and the transition to French rule.</p>

You'll find them everywhere, from high-end boutiques to the bustling stalls of the Papeete Market. 

Monoi oil is a fragrant, infused perfume oil made from soaking the petals of Tahitian gardenias (tiare flowers) in coconut oil. It's used for moisturizing skin and hair and is a signature scent of the islands. Exploring the different shops, smelling the various scents of monoi, and choosing a vibrant pareu is a cultural activity in itself and provides the perfect authentic souvenir.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Walking is easy for the compact downtown area, including the market, waterfront, and ferry terminal. For longer distances, taxis are available but can be expensive; always agree on a fare beforehand. 'Le Truck' is the informal public bus system—it's cheap and a local experience, but runs on a loose schedule. Rental cars are the best option for exploring the entire island of Tahiti at your own pace.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>For convenience, stay near the Papeete waterfront or downtown area, which puts you within walking distance of attractions and restaurants. For a more resort-style experience, the Puna'auia commune, west of the city, has several beachfront hotels with stunning lagoon views. Recommendations: Hotel Tahiti Nui (downtown, mid-range), InterContinental Tahiti Resort & Spa (Puna'auia, luxury), or Mahana Lodge Hostel & Backpacker (budget).</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Papeete is during the dry season, from May to October. You'll experience less rain, lower humidity, and plenty of sunshine, making it ideal for outdoor activities. This is also the peak tourist season, so expect higher prices and more crowds. The wet season, from November to April, sees more rain and humidity but also fewer tourists and often lower prices. The famous Heiva Nui cultural festival takes place in July, making it a vibrant but busy time to visit.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Papeete expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, Papeete and French Polynesia in general are considered expensive travel destinations. This is primarily because most goods, from food to fuel, have to be imported. Accommodation, tours, and restaurant dining can be costly. To save money, eat at the 'roulottes' (food trucks), shop for supplies at local supermarkets like Carrefour, and utilize 'Le Truck' for transportation where possible.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Two to three days are sufficient to explore the main sights of Papeete itself.
