Located in Nueva Córdoba, its asymmetrical facade immediately captures attention—one tower is finished while the other is intentionally incomplete, symbolizing humanity's imperfection and the constant journey towards God.\n\nThe church's exterior is adorned with a host of intricate sculptures and gargoyles, while the interior is just as breathtaking, with soaring vaulted ceilings and vibrant stained-glass windows that bathe the space in colored light. It's a masterpiece of detail and symbolism, built by architect Augusto Ferrari, who integrated elements representing both the earthly and heavenly worlds.",

The church's exterior is adorned with a host of intricate sculptures and gargoyles, while the interior is just as breathtaking, with soaring vaulted ceilings and vibrant stained-glass windows that bathe the space in colored light. It's a masterpiece of detail and symbolism, built by architect Augusto Ferrari, who integrated elements representing both the earthly and heavenly worlds.</p>
