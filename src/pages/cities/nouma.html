                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Nouméa is relatively spread out. The Karuïa bus network is an affordable way to get between the city center (Centre-Ville), Anse Vata, and Baie des Citrons. Taxis are available but can be expensive. For flexibility, especially for exploring beyond the main bays, renting a car is a good option. To visit the nearby islets like Île aux Canards and Phare Amédée, dedicated water taxis and tour boats are readily available from Anse Vata and Port Moselle.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>Most tourists stay in the southern beach suburbs. Anse Vata is the main hub, with large resorts and proximity to water sports. Baie des Citrons is slightly quieter and perfect for those who want to be close to a calmer swimming beach and great restaurants. The Centre-Ville (downtown) offers more budget-friendly hotels and a local feel, close to the market and museums.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Nouméa expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, Nouméa can be quite expensive. As a French territory, prices for accommodation, food, and activities are comparable to those in Western Europe or Australia, and significantly higher than in other Pacific island nations or Southeast Asia. Many goods are imported, which drives up the cost. To save money, consider self-catering apartments, shopping at local markets and supermarkets, and utilizing the public bus system.</div>
