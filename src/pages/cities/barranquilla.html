Even if you don't dance, just grabbing a plastic chair on the sidewalk, ordering a cold Aguila beer, and watching the masters at work is an unforgettable cultural experience.

Its construction spanned several decades, finally being consecrated in 1982. The cathedral's massive size and unique, angular design set it apart from traditional colonial churches. Inside, you'll find a cavernous space filled with light from its impressive stained-glass windows, which depict biblical scenes with a modern artistic flair.\n\nOne of the most striking features is the large sculpture of Christ on the main altar. Whether you are religious or not, the sheer scale and bold design of the cathedral make it an important architectural landmark worth visiting. It reflects the forward-looking spirit of 20th-century Barranquilla.",
