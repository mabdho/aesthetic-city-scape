The southern, car-free islands like Styrsö and Brännö are easily accessible via public transport ferries and are perfect for serene walks, swimming in sheltered coves, and enjoying picturesque fishing villages. The northern islands, such as Hönö and Öckerö, are larger and can be reached by car ferry, offering a different but equally charming coastal vibe.\n\nSpending a day island-hopping is the perfect antidote to city life. Pack a picnic, rent a bicycle, or simply find a smooth, sun-warmed granite rock to relax on. The stark natural beauty, dotted with traditional red wooden houses, provides a glimpse into the authentic soul of Sweden's west coast.",

                    <h3>Gothenburg Archipelago</h3>
                    <p>An essential Gothenburg experience, the archipelago is a stunning collection of over 20 islands stretching up the coast. The southern, car-free islands like Styrsö and Brännö are easily accessible via public transport ferries and are perfect for serene walks, swimming in sheltered coves, and enjoying picturesque fishing villages. The northern islands, such as Hönö and Öckerö, are larger and can be reached by car ferry, offering a different but equally charming coastal vibe.

Spending a day island-hopping is the perfect antidote to city life. Pack a picnic, rent a bicycle, or simply find a smooth, sun-warmed granite rock to relax on. The stark natural beauty, dotted with traditional red wooden houses, provides a glimpse into the authentic soul of Sweden's west coast.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Gothenburg has a superb public transport system, Västtrafik, consisting of trams, buses, and ferries. Trams are the best way to get around the city center. A single ticket is valid for 90 minutes. For longer stays, consider a 24-hour or 72-hour pass. The city is very walkable, and cycling is also a great option with many dedicated bike lanes and a bike-share system called Styr & Ställ.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>For first-time visitors, the area Inom Vallgraven (within the moat) offers central convenience. The charming districts of Haga and Linné are perfect for a cozier, more local feel with great cafes and boutiques. Vasastan is elegant and quiet yet still central. Recommended hotels include Hotel Pigalle (boutique), Avalon Hotel (design-focused), and the Clarion Hotel Post (large and central).</p>

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Gothenburg is during the summer months (June to August) when the weather is warm, the city is vibrant with outdoor cafes, and events like the Way Out West festival take place. The archipelago is also at its most accessible. Spring (April-May) and autumn (September-October) offer pleasant weather with fewer crowds. Winter is cold, but the city becomes magical with its famous Christmas market at Liseberg.</p>
