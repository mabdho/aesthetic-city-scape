The history within these walls is palpable, with ghosts of performances by everyone from Hank Williams and Patsy Cline to Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley.\n\nTake a self-guided or guided tour during the day to learn about its incredible history and see memorabilia.

Inside, it functions as an art museum and features a colossal, 42-foot-tall statue of the goddess Athena, gilded with real gold leaf. It's a surreal and impressive attraction that offers a dose of classical history in the heart of Music City.",

Guided tours, led by costumed interpreters, detail the stories of the Harding and Jackson families who owned the estate, as well as the enslaved individuals whose labor built and sustained it.\n\nAfter the mansion tour, your ticket includes a complimentary wine tasting at the on-site winery. Belle Meade was one of the first licensed wineries in Tennessee, and tasting their Southern-style fruit wines is a perfect way to conclude your visit.

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Downtown Nashville is very walkable. For longer distances, rideshare services like Uber and Lyft are abundant and are the most common way to get around. The city's public bus system, WeGo Public Transit, is an affordable option. For a fun, touristy experience, consider the hop-on-hop-off trolley tours. Renting a car is recommended only if you plan to visit many attractions outside the downtown core, like The Hermitage or Radnor Lake, as parking downtown can be expensive and difficult to find.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>For first-time visitors who want to be in the center of the action, Downtown or SoBro (South of Broadway) is ideal, with hotels like The Joseph or the Grand Hyatt. The Gulch offers trendy, upscale hotels like the Thompson Nashville. For a more local, bohemian vibe, look for Airbnbs or boutique hotels in East Nashville. Music Row/Midtown is another great option, slightly removed from the downtown chaos but still close to many attractions and Vanderbilt University.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Nashville expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Nashville's costs are on par with other major US cities but can vary greatly depending on your choices. While there are many free things to do like walking the pedestrian bridge or listening to music in honky-tonks (with the cost of a drink), ticketed attractions, concerts, and tours can add up. Accommodation in the downtown core is expensive, especially on weekends. Food costs can range from cheap (hot chicken shacks) to very high-end. Overall, it's possible to visit on a budget, but a typical tourist trip can be moderately expensive.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">A 3-day weekend is the perfect amount of time to get a great taste of Nashville. This allows you to cover the main music attractions downtown, explore a couple of distinct neighborhoods like The Gulch or 12 South, and enjoy the nightlife.

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Nashville safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Nashville is generally safe for tourists, especially in the main areas like Downtown, The Gulch, and Music Row where there is a heavy police presence. However, like any large city, it's important to be aware of your surroundings. The crowds on Lower Broadway at night can be intense, so keep your belongings secure. Petty crime like pickpocketing can occur. It's wise to use rideshare services at night rather than walking long distances alone in unfamiliar areas.</div>
