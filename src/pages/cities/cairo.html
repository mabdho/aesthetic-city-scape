The Great Pyramid of Khufu, along with the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure, has stood for over 4,500 years, a testament to the ingenuity and power of the Pharaonic civilization. Standing at their base is a humbling experience that connects you directly to the distant past. Nearby, the enigmatic Sphinx, a limestone statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, guards the complex. You can explore the plateau on foot, by camel, or on horseback, but be sure to take a moment to absorb the sheer scale and historical significance of these monumental structures. For a truly magical experience, visit during the evening Sound and Light Show.",

Dating back to the 14th century, this labyrinthine market is a whirlwind of sights, sounds, and smells. Narrow alleyways are crammed with shops selling everything from intricate lanterns, spices, and perfumes to jewelry, papyrus, and alabaster statues. Haggling is part of the experience, so don't be shy. Even if you're not shopping, wandering through the souk is an adventure in itself.

The complex houses several important sites, most notably the magnificent Mosque of Muhammad Ali. Also known as the Alabaster Mosque for its extensive use of the stone, its Ottoman-style architecture and grand domes dominate the city skyline. Exploring the ramparts, museums, and mosques within the Citadel provides a fascinating glimpse into Cairo's military and political history.",

This area is the historical heart of Egypt's Christian community and contains some of the country's oldest churches. It is believed that the Holy Family stayed here during their flight into Egypt. Key sites include the Hanging Church (El Muallaqa), built atop the bastions of a Roman fortress, the Church of St. Sergius and Bacchus, where the Holy Family is said to have rested, and the Ben Ezra Synagogue, reportedly located where the baby Moses was found.

This measurement was crucial for ancient and medieval Egypt, as it determined the prosperity of the coming year's harvest and the level of taxation. The structure is an ornate, stone-lined pit with a central column marked with cubits. You can descend a staircase into the well to see the intricate Islamic architecture and markings up close. It's a small but incredibly well-preserved piece of history that offers a unique insight into the practicalities of life in medieval Cairo and the river that sustained it.",

Its most unique feature is the spiral minaret, which you can climb for stunning views of the mosque's vast courtyard and the surrounding city. Unlike the more ornate mosques in Cairo, Ibn Tulun's beauty lies in its elegant simplicity and immense scale.

As the boat glides quietly on the water, you'll see the city's skyline from a completely different perspective. The horns and traffic fade away, replaced by the gentle lapping of waves and the breeze in the sails. It's a perfect way to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. You can hire a felucca for an hour or two from various docks, particularly in the Garden City and Zamalek areas.

What makes it unique is that it's also a living neighborhood, with entire families residing among the ornate tombs and mausoleums of former pashas, sultans, and wealthy merchants. While it might sound macabre, a guided visit offers a fascinating, off-the-beaten-path look at a unique aspect of Cairo's urban fabric and social history. The area contains some stunning Mamluk-era architecture. It's strongly recommended to visit with a knowledgeable local guide who can navigate the area respectfully and provide historical context, ensuring a safe and insightful experience.",

This massive gate is flanked by two impressive minarets, which belong to the nearby Mosque of al-Mu'ayyad. What makes Bab Zuweila a must-visit is that you can climb to the top.

It was the epicenter of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution and has been a focal point for political expression for decades. The square is a vast, bustling roundabout surrounded by key landmarks, including the Egyptian Museum, the American University in Cairo building, and the Mogamma government building. While visiting, it's less about seeing specific sights and more about feeling the pulse of the city and reflecting on the recent events that have shaped modern Egypt. A walk through the square is a powerful reminder of the country's living history.",

                    <p>No trip to Cairo is complete without visiting the Giza Plateau, home to the last remaining wonder of the ancient world. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, along with the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure, has stood for over 4,500 years, a testament to the ingenuity and power of the Pharaonic civilization. Standing at their base is a humbling experience that connects you directly to the distant past. Nearby, the enigmatic Sphinx, a limestone statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, guards the complex. You can explore the plateau on foot, by camel, or on horseback, but be sure to take a moment to absorb the sheer scale and historical significance of these monumental structures. For a truly magical experience, visit during the evening Sound and Light Show.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Navigating Cairo is an adventure. Ride-sharing apps like Uber and Careem are the most convenient and affordable options for tourists, offering fixed prices and avoiding haggling. The Cairo Metro is efficient, cheap, and a great way to travel long distances and avoid traffic, with dedicated carriages for women. Traditional black and white taxis are available but require negotiation. For short distances in less-congested areas, walking can be enjoyable.</p>

                    <p>Zamalek: An upscale island district with boutique hotels, fine dining, and a relaxed vibe. Ideal for those seeking a quieter base. Downtown Cairo: Offers a mix of grand old hotels and budget-friendly options, putting you in the heart of the action near Tahrir Square.

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Cairo is from October to April when the weather is pleasantly mild and sunny, perfect for sightseeing. Spring (March-April) and autumn (October-November) offer the most comfortable temperatures. Summers (June-August) are extremely hot and dry, which can make exploring during the day challenging. Winter (December-February) is cooler, especially in the evenings, but still very pleasant.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Cairo expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Compared to major Western cities, Cairo is very affordable for travelers. Accommodation, food, and transportation are relatively inexpensive. You can eat a delicious local meal like koshary for less than $2, and an Uber ride across town might cost only $3-5. Entrance fees to major tourist sites are the biggest expense, but are still reasonable. You can travel comfortably on a budget or indulge in luxury for far less than you would in Europe or North America.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How many days do you need in Cairo?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">To see the main highlights without feeling rushed, 3 to 4 full days is ideal. This allows you to dedicate a day to the Giza Pyramids and the museums, another day to Islamic and Coptic Cairo, and a third day for markets, the Nile, and other sites. If you want to explore more deeply, take day trips (e.g., to Saqqara and Dahshur), or simply travel at a more relaxed pace, 5 to 7 days would be even better.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Cairo safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cairo is generally safe for tourists, but like any massive city, it requires awareness. The primary concerns are petty crime (like pickpocketing in crowded areas) and scams. Keep your valuables secure and be firm but polite when declining unsolicited offers. Traffic is chaotic, so be extremely careful when crossing streets. Solo female travelers should dress modestly to avoid unwanted attention. By taking standard precautions, most visitors have a trouble-free and welcoming experience.</div>
