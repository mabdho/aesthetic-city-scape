                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Tampere is during the summer (June to August) when the weather is warm, the days are long, and the city is alive with festivals and lakeside activities. Autumn (September-October) offers stunning fall colors on the ridges. Winter (December-March) is cold and snowy but magical, with Christmas markets and the chance to try ice-swimming. Spring (April-May) is when the city awakens from winter, with melting ice and budding trees.</p>
