A sealed road makes many of its key sights accessible on a day trip. You can swim in the chilly waters of Ellery Creek Big Hole, marvel at the sheer cliffs of Ormiston Gorge, and search for rock wallabies at Simpsons Gap. Each gorge and chasm holds deep cultural significance for the local Arrernte people, adding a rich layer of history to the spectacular scenery.

Today, the beautifully restored stone buildings offer a tangible link to the past.

This hilltop memorial, officially known as Untyeyetwelye, is dedicated to the members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who served in World War I and all subsequent conflicts. The view is spectacular at any time of day, but it's particularly magical at sunrise or sunset, when the changing light paints the ranges in stunning shades of purple, orange, and red. It provides a perfect orientation to the town's layout and the vast landscape that cradles it.",

It's a 188-acre wildlife reserve dedicated to rescuing and caring for orphaned kangaroos. The only way to visit is on a pre-booked sunset tour, a magical experience where you can walk amongst the kangaroos as they come out to feed. Brolga's passion for his 'mob' is infectious, and you'll leave with a newfound appreciation for Australia's most famous marsupial. Holding a joey (baby kangaroo) is often a highlight. Book well in advance, as tours are small and sell out quickly.",

The chasm is at its most dramatic around midday, when the sun is directly overhead. For a brief period, the sunlight floods the narrow gap, illuminating the sheer quartzite walls and turning them a brilliant, fiery orange. It's a photographer's dream. The 1.2km walk to the chasm along the creek bed is beautiful in itself, and there's a cafe on site for refreshments.",

                    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>The best time to visit Alice Springs is during the cooler, drier months from April to September. Daytime temperatures are pleasant (around 20-25°C or 68-77°F), perfect for hiking and exploring. Nights can be very cold, often dropping near freezing, so pack layers. The summer months (October to March) can be extremely hot, with temperatures frequently exceeding 40°C (104°F), making outdoor activities challenging.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Alice Springs expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Alice Springs can be more expensive than major Australian cities due to its remote location. Flights and car hire should be booked in advance for better prices. Accommodation costs are on par with other tourist destinations. Groceries, fuel, and dining out can be slightly higher due to freight costs. However, many of the best attractions, like hiking in the national parks, are free, which can balance the budget.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How many days do you need in Alice Springs?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">A minimum of 3 to 4 days is recommended. This allows one full day to explore the attractions within the town, a full day for a trip out to the West MacDonnell Ranges, and another day for the Desert Park and other activities like a camel ride.

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Alice Springs safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Alice Springs is generally safe for tourists, but like any town, it has complex social issues. It is wise to exercise common sense. Stick to well-lit areas at night, especially around the Todd River bed, and avoid walking alone late at night. Lock your vehicle and don't leave valuables in sight. During the day, the town and tourist attractions are perfectly safe. Standard travel awareness is all that is required.</div>
