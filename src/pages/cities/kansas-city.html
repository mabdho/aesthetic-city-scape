It's a religion here, characterized by slow-smoked meats, a thick, sweet, and tangy tomato-based sauce, and beloved side dishes.

From the iconic burnt ends (cubes of brisket point) to fall-off-the-bone ribs and pulled pork, trying KC 'cue is an essential cultural experience.\n\nChoosing where to go is part of the fun. For a classic experience, head to Arthur Bryant's or Gates Bar-B-Q, where you'll be greeted with a loud 'Hi, may I help you?'. For a more modern yet equally revered take, the gas station-born Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que is a must-try, often with a line out the door. Other standouts include Q39, Jack Stack, and Slap's BBQ.",

                    <p>A profoundly moving and comprehensive institution, the National WWI Museum and Memorial is America's official museum dedicated to World War I.

                    <p>You cannot visit Kansas City without experiencing its most famous culinary contribution: barbecue.

From the iconic burnt ends (cubes of brisket point) to fall-off-the-bone ribs and pulled pork, trying KC 'cue is an essential cultural experience.

Choosing where to go is part of the fun. For a classic experience, head to Arthur Bryant's or Gates Bar-B-Q, where you'll be greeted with a loud 'Hi, may I help you?'. For a more modern yet equally revered take, the gas station-born Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que is a must-try, often with a line out the door.

                    <p>A powerful and important American institution, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (NLBM) chronicles the history of African American baseball from the late 1800s to the 1960s.

The culminating exhibit is the moving 'Field of Legends,' where nearly life-sized bronze statues of Negro Leagues greats are positioned on a mock baseball diamond as if in the middle of a game. It is a poignant and inspiring tribute that you won't soon forget.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Navigating the core of Kansas City is easy thanks to the free KC Streetcar, which runs a 2.2-mile route from the River Market through Downtown, the Crossroads Arts District, and down to Union Station. For areas outside this corridor, like the Country Club Plaza or the 18th & Vine District, you'll need to use the RideKC bus system, a rideshare service like Uber or Lyft, or rent a car. A car is recommended if you plan to visit the Truman Sports Complex or venture to barbecue joints in Kansas.</p>
