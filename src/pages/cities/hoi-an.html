The bridge is unique in that it has a temple built into its northern side, dedicated to the northern deity Tran Vo Bac De, who is believed to control the weather.\n\nAdorned with intricate carvings, including a pair of monkey statues at one end and dog statues at the other, the bridge is a masterpiece of craftsmanship. It's a must-see landmark and one of the sites included in the Ancient Town ticket. Be sure to visit both during the day to appreciate the details and at night when it's beautifully lit.",

This impressive complex of abandoned and partially ruined Hindu temples was constructed between the 4th and 14th centuries by the Champa Kingdom. Nestled in a lush green valley, these brick towers were dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.\n\nThough heavily damaged by bombing during the Vietnam War, the remaining structures are evocative and atmospheric, often drawing comparisons to a smaller-scale Angkor Wat. It's best to visit early in the morning to avoid the heat and the crowds. You can book a guided tour from Hoi An, which often includes a boat trip back along the Thu Bon River.",

As darkness falls, the riverfront comes alive with local women and children selling small, colorful lanterns with a candle inside.

Paddled by a local, you'll be able to release your lantern from the middle of the river, surrounded by hundreds of other floating lights. It's a peaceful and picturesque activity that perfectly captures the romantic spirit of Hoi An.",

Many classes begin with a guided tour of the bustling Central Market to learn about fresh Vietnamese ingredients like herbs, spices, and local produce. You'll then head to a kitchen, often in a scenic location by the river or amidst rice fields.\n\nUnder the guidance of a local chef, you'll learn to prepare several classic Vietnamese and Hoi An specialty dishes, such as pho, fresh spring rolls (gỏi cuốn), and crispy pancakes (bánh xèo).

                    <h3>Cross the Japanese Covered Bridge</h3>
                    <p>The iconic symbol of Hoi An, the Japanese Covered Bridge (Chùa Cầu), is a beautiful example of Japanese architecture dating back to the 18th century. It was built by the Japanese community to connect their quarter with the Chinese quarter across a small canal. The bridge is unique in that it has a temple built into its northern side, dedicated to the northern deity Tran Vo Bac De, who is believed to control the weather.

Adorned with intricate carvings, including a pair of monkey statues at one end and dog statues at the other, the bridge is a masterpiece of craftsmanship. It's a must-see landmark and one of the sites included in the Ancient Town ticket. Be sure to visit both during the day to appreciate the details and at night when it's beautifully lit.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Hoi An's Ancient Town is pedestrian-friendly and best explored on foot. Bicycles are the most popular way to get around the wider area, including to the beaches and through the rice paddies; most hotels offer them for free or for a small daily fee. For longer distances, 'Grab' (the Southeast Asian equivalent of Uber) is widely available and affordable for both cars and motorbikes. Traditional cyclos offer a more leisurely, scenic tour of the town.</p>
