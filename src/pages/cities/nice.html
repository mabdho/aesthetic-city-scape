This iconic seafront boulevard was established in the 19th century by English aristocrats who wintered on the Riviera, and its grandeur remains today. It's a hub of activity from dawn until dusk, perfect for a leisurely stroll, a bike ride on its dedicated path, or simply relaxing on one of its famous blue chairs while gazing at the turquoise Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe promenade is lined with elegant Belle Époque hotels, including the legendary Le Negresco, and separates the city from its famous pebble beaches. It's the social and scenic heart of Nice, offering spectacular sunrises and sunsets, and a constant parade of locals and tourists soaking up the Riviera atmosphere. It's an absolute must-see and the perfect starting point for any visit.",

      "description": "Step back in time as you wander into the labyrinthine streets of Vieux Nice. This historic quarter is a delightful maze of narrow, winding alleyways, shaded squares, and pastel-colored buildings with charming wooden shutters. The area exudes an Italianate feel, a nod to its past, and is packed with artisan shops, quaint boutiques, authentic ice cream parlors (fenocchio is a must-try!), and traditional Niçois restaurants.\n\nKey sights within the Old Town include the Cathédrale Sainte-Réparate and the Palais Lascaris. But the real joy is getting lost, discovering hidden courtyards, and soaking up the lively, authentic atmosphere. It’s a sensory experience, filled with the scents of fresh flowers from the Cours Saleya, the sound of church bells, and the vibrant colors of daily life.",

      "description": "For the most breathtaking panoramic views of Nice, the Baie des Anges, the old port, and the surrounding Alps, a trip up Castle Hill is essential. Although the original citadel was dismantled by Louis XIV's troops in 1706, the hilltop has been transformed into a magnificent park. It's a peaceful oasis with lush greenery, playgrounds for children, ancient ruins, and a stunning man-made waterfall.\n\nYou can reach the summit via a free elevator (ascenseur) from the seaside, or by climbing the scenic staircases from the Old Town or the port side. It's the perfect spot for a picnic, a relaxing afternoon, and capturing postcard-perfect photos of the city below. The views at sunset are particularly magical.",

From Tuesday to Sunday, it's a riot of color and fragrance as the Marché aux Fleurs (Flower Market) takes over, alongside stalls selling fresh produce, local cheeses, olives, and spices. It's the perfect place to sample local delicacies like socca, a chickpea pancake cooked in a wood-fired oven.\n\nOn Mondays, the square transforms into a sprawling Marché à la Brocante, an antiques and flea market where you can hunt for unique treasures and vintage finds. The market is surrounded by lively cafés and restaurants with terraces, making it an ideal spot for people-watching over a morning coffee or a leisurely lunch.",

It was created to house Chagall's series of 17 large paintings illustrating the biblical message, from the books of Genesis, Exodus, and the Song of Songs. The main gallery is bathed in natural light, allowing the artist's famously vibrant and spiritual works to shine.\n\nBeyond the main collection, the museum also features a wealth of other works including sculptures, stained glass, mosaics, and numerous sketches and lithographs. The building itself is a modernist masterpiece, surrounded by a serene Mediterranean garden. Even if you're not an art historian, the sheer beauty and emotional power of Chagall's work in this purpose-built space is deeply moving.",

The museum's collection spans Matisse's entire career, showcasing his evolution as an artist through paintings, drawings, sculptures, and his famous paper cut-outs.\n\nVisitors can see some of his most significant works, including 'Nature morte aux grenades' and the iconic 'Nu bleu IV'. The collection provides a fascinating insight into his creative process and his deep connection to the light and colors of the French Riviera. The surrounding olive grove and the nearby Roman ruins add to the charm of the visit.",

      "description": "A stunning and unexpected sight in the heart of the French Riviera, the Saint-Nicolas Cathedral is the largest Russian Orthodox cathedral in Western Europe. Built in the early 20th century and funded by Tsar Nicholas II, its ornate, onion-domed architecture seems transported directly from Moscow. The vibrant colors of its ceramic tiles and the glint of its six golden domes are a spectacular contrast to the surrounding Niçois architecture.\n\nStep inside to discover a richly decorated interior filled with intricate icons, murals, and woodwork, all crafted in Russia and brought to Nice. It's a national monument of France and a testament to the long-standing history of the Russian community on the Côte d'Azur. A visit offers a unique cultural and architectural experience.",

Its distinctive features include the checkerboard black-and-white tiling, striking red ochre buildings, and the Fontaine du Soleil, a grand fountain featuring a large statue of Apollo. The square is a major hub, connecting the Old Town, the new town, and the Promenade des Anglais.\n\nLining the square are high-end shops and galleries, and it's a frequent venue for public events, concerts, and festivals. At night, the square takes on a magical quality when the seven statues of the 'Conversation à Nice' art installation, representing the seven continents, are illuminated in changing colors.",

The collection focuses on European New Realism and American Pop Art from the 1960s onwards, with significant works by artists like Yves Klein (a Nice native), Niki de Saint Phalle, and Andy Warhol.\n\nThe real highlight is the panoramic roof terrace, which offers some of the best 360-degree views of the city, encompassing the Old Town, the sea, and the surrounding hills. The terrace itself is an art installation, making it a spectacular place to conclude your visit.",

Built by Baroness Béatrice de Rothschild, the rose-colored palace is a masterpiece of Belle Époque architecture, filled with an eclectic collection of art, tapestries, and antique furniture. The true star, however, is the garden—or rather, gardens.\n\nThe estate is surrounded by nine distinct themed gardens: French, Spanish, Japanese, Florentine, and more. The main French garden is designed to resemble the deck of a ship, with musical fountains that come to life every 20 minutes. It's a place of immense beauty and tranquility, offering stunning views over the bays of Villefranche and Beaulieu.",

Flanked by beautiful 18th-century arcaded buildings in shades of red and yellow ochre, it has a more local and relaxed feel than the glitzy marinas further down the coast. Here you'll find a mix of traditional fishing boats ('pointus'), sleek yachts, and ferries departing for Corsica.\n\nThe port area is surrounded by excellent seafood restaurants and chic bars, making it a wonderful place for a meal or an evening drink while watching the boats. For a great view, walk along the quays or climb the steps towards Mont Boron. It's a picturesque and authentic slice of Niçois life.",

Located just east of the port, this 140-acre park is crisscrossed with walking trails that meander through Aleppo pines and olive groves. The main attraction is the panoramic viewpoint at the summit, which provides a stunning vista over the entire city of Nice on one side and the breathtaking peninsula of Cap-Ferrat on the other.\n\nAt the top, you'll also find the historic Fort du Mont Alban, a 16th-century military fortress. While the fort itself has limited opening hours, the park is always accessible and is a favorite spot for locals to walk, jog, and picnic away from the city bustle.",

If you're in the mood for shopping, this is the place to be. The wide avenue is lined with major international brands, French department stores like Galeries Lafayette, and the Nicetoile shopping center, which houses dozens of retailers and a food court.\n\nThe street is mostly pedestrianized, with the tram line running down its center, making it easy and pleasant to navigate. It's more than just a shopping street; it's a vibrant showcase of modern Nice, buzzing with energy and showcasing beautiful Haussmannian architecture alongside contemporary buildings.",

The small church contains several important works of art, including three masterpieces by the Niçois painter Louis Bréa. The adjacent museum details the life and work of the Franciscans in Nice through frescoes, documents, and artifacts.\n\nHowever, the main draw for many visitors is the monastery's spectacular garden. Formerly the monks' vegetable patch, it has been transformed into a beautifully manicured garden offering one of the most lovely views in Nice, looking out over the Old Town and the sea. With its tidy flowerbeds, pergolas covered in climbing roses, and serene atmosphere, it's a perfect spot for quiet contemplation.",

The park is a fantastic destination for families or anyone with an interest in botany and wildlife.\n\nOutside the greenhouse, the park is beautifully landscaped with themed gardens, ponds filled with ducks and pelicans, and enclosures for animals like otters, wallabies, and porcupines.
