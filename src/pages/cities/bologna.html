Lined with magnificent buildings like the Palazzo d'Accursio (City Hall), the Palazzo dei Notai, and the Palazzo dei Banchi, it's the perfect starting point for any visit. Dominating the adjacent Piazza del Nettuno is the iconic Fountain of Neptune, a powerful bronze sculpture by Giambologna from the 16th century. The square is a lively meeting place for locals and tourists alike, hosting events, markets, and open-air film screenings in the summer. It's an essential spot to soak in the city's atmosphere.",

      "name": "Le Due Torri (The Two Towers)",
      "description": "The Asinelli and Garisenda towers are the most iconic symbols of Bologna. These leaning medieval structures are survivors of a time when the city was filled with hundreds of such towers, built by wealthy families for defense and as status symbols. The taller Asinelli Tower, standing at 97.2 meters, is open to the public. Climbing its 498 steps is a rite of passage for visitors and rewards you with breathtaking panoramic views of Bologna's red-roofed cityscape. The shorter, more dramatically leaning Garisenda Tower is not climbable but adds to the picturesque scene.",

      "name": "Basilica di San Petronio",
      "description": "Dominating one side of Piazza Maggiore, the Basilica di San Petronio is one of the largest churches in the world. Its construction began in 1390 but was never fully completed, resulting in a fascinatingly unfinished marble and brick facade. Inside, the sheer scale of the Gothic interior is awe-inspiring. Don't miss the Cassini Meridian Line, a 67-meter-long brass line embedded in the floor that acts as a solar calendar, accurately calculating the time of year. For a unique perspective, take the elevator up to the Terrazza Panoramica for stunning views of the square and the city.",

      "description": "The Archiginnasio was the first permanent seat of the University of Bologna, the oldest university in the Western world. The building itself is a masterpiece, with courtyards and halls covered in nearly 6,000 coats of arms from former students and professors. The main attraction is the 17th-century Anatomical Theatre (Teatro Anatomico). Carved entirely from fir wood, this stunning lecture hall is where medical students once witnessed public dissections. The intricate wooden sculptures, including the famous 'Spellati' (skinned men) holding up the canopy over the professor's chair, make it a truly unique and slightly macabre sight.",

      "description": "Just off Piazza Maggiore lies the Quadrilatero, a maze of narrow medieval streets that has been Bologna's main market area for centuries. This is the heart of 'La Grassa' (the fat Bologna), a foodie paradise where the air is thick with the smells of fresh pasta, aged cheeses, cured meats, and freshly baked bread. The streets, named after the trades that once dominated them (like Via Pescherie Vecchie for fishmongers), are packed with historic delis, butchers, bakeries, and market stalls. It's the perfect place to sample local specialties, buy delicious souvenirs, or enjoy an aperitivo at one of the many bustling outdoor tables.",

      "description": "Perched atop a forested hill overlooking Bologna, this magnificent basilica is a significant pilgrimage site. What makes the journey truly special is the Portico di San Luca, the world's longest portico. Stretching for nearly 4 kilometers and consisting of 666 arches, this covered walkway connects the city's Saragozza gate to the sanctuary. Walking the entire length is a rewarding experience, offering changing views and a sense of accomplishment. Alternatively, the San Luca Express tourist train can take you to the top. The sanctuary itself offers stunning architecture and breathtaking views of the city and surrounding hills.",

      "description": "Often called the 'Sette Chiese' (Seven Churches), this complex is one of the most unique and spiritually captivating places in Bologna. It's not a single basilica but a labyrinthine cluster of interconnected religious buildings constructed over different eras, from the 5th century onwards. The complex includes the Church of the Crucifix, the Basilica of the Sepulchre (modelled on Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre), and a beautiful medieval cloister. Wandering through its different chapels, courtyards, and crypts feels like stepping back in time. It provides a peaceful and fascinating escape from the bustling city streets.",

This small, unassuming window in a wall opens up to a surprisingly charming view of the Canale delle Moline, one of the few remaining canals that once powered the city's mills. Often referred to as 'Little Venice', the view of the colourful houses lining the water is a secret, picturesque spot that many tourists miss. It's a quick but delightful stop that offers a glimpse into a different side of Bologna's history and a perfect photo opportunity.",

Housed in a former Jesuit novitiate within the university district, this gallery boasts one of Italy's most important collections of Emilian painting from the 13th to the 18th centuries. The collection features seminal works by masters like Giotto, Raphael (The Ecstasy of St. Cecilia), Parmigianino, and the Carracci brothers, who founded the Bolognese School of painting. The layout guides you chronologically, offering a deep dive into the evolution of art in the region. It's a comprehensive and impressive collection that provides context to the art seen in the city's churches.",

It’s where locals do their daily shopping for fresh produce, meat, fish, and cheese. The original structure, a beautiful iron and glass building from the early 20th century, houses traditional market stalls.

It was founded by Saint Dominic himself in the 13th century and houses his remains in an ornate shrine, the Arca di San Domenico. This marble tomb is a masterpiece of sculpture, featuring contributions from various artists over centuries, including a young Michelangelo, who carved three of the small statues. The church also boasts a beautifully inlaid wooden choir and numerous chapels filled with important artworks. It's a quieter but no less impressive alternative to the main basilica on Piazza Maggiore.",

Its prized possession is its Egyptian collection, second in Italy only to the one in Turin. You can explore beautifully preserved sarcophagi, papyri, and artifacts from ancient Egypt. The museum also offers extensive sections on prehistoric, Etruscan, and Roman Bologna, providing a deep historical context for the city you see today.

Its walls are adorned with a magnificent cycle of ten frescoes depicting the life of Saint Cecilia, painted by prominent artists of the era, including Lorenzo Costa and Francesco Francia. The colors remain incredibly vibrant, and the level of detail is stunning. Because it's less famous than other sights, you can often enjoy this artistic treasure in relative peace and quiet.",

The taller Asinelli Tower, standing at 97.2 meters, is open to the public. Climbing its 498 steps is a rite of passage for visitors and rewards you with breathtaking panoramic views of Bologna's red-roofed cityscape. The shorter, more dramatically leaning Garisenda Tower is not climbable but adds to the picturesque scene.</p>

                    <h3>Basilica di San Petronio</h3>
                    <p>Dominating one side of Piazza Maggiore, the Basilica di San Petronio is one of the largest churches in the world. Its construction began in 1390 but was never fully completed, resulting in a fascinatingly unfinished marble and brick facade. Inside, the sheer scale of the Gothic interior is awe-inspiring. Don't miss the Cassini Meridian Line, a 67-meter-long brass line embedded in the floor that acts as a solar calendar, accurately calculating the time of year. For a unique perspective, take the elevator up to the Terrazza Panoramica for stunning views of the square and the city.</p>

                    <p>The Archiginnasio was the first permanent seat of the University of Bologna, the oldest university in the Western world. The building itself is a masterpiece, with courtyards and halls covered in nearly 6,000 coats of arms from former students and professors. The main attraction is the 17th-century Anatomical Theatre (Teatro Anatomico). Carved entirely from fir wood, this stunning lecture hall is where medical students once witnessed public dissections. The intricate wooden sculptures, including the famous 'Spellati' (skinned men) holding up the canopy over the professor's chair, make it a truly unique and slightly macabre sight.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Bologna expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Bologna is generally considered more affordable than major tourist hubs like Rome, Florence, or Venice, but it is not a rock-bottom budget destination. Accommodation and dining can be found for a range of budgets. A sit-down meal with wine can cost €25-€40, while a slice of pizza or a panino offers a cheaper option. Many key attractions like churches are free, but special exhibits or climbing towers have fees. Overall, it offers good value for an authentic Italian city experience.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Bologna safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, Bologna is generally a very safe city. The crime rate is low, and the biggest concern for tourists is petty crime like pickpocketing, which can occur in crowded areas like Piazza Maggiore, markets, or on public transport. As with any city, it's wise to be aware of your surroundings, keep valuables secure, and avoid walking alone in poorly lit areas late at night. The student population keeps the city lively and well-populated in the evenings.</div>
