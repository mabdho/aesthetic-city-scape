Its five large plazas, including the magnificent Plaza de la Catedral and the bustling Plaza Vieja, are connected by a labyrinth of narrow, cobblestone streets. Every corner reveals beautifully restored baroque and neoclassical buildings, charming courtyards, and lively street scenes. It's a place to get lost intentionally, discovering hidden cafes, art galleries, and the pulse of daily Cuban life.\n\nSpend hours meandering without a plan, soaking in the atmosphere. You'll encounter street musicians, artists selling their work, and locals going about their day.

      "description": "The Malecón is Havana’s legendary 8-kilometer-long esplanade, sea drive, and seawall, stretching from Old Havana to the Vedado neighborhood. It’s often called 'the world’s longest sofa,' as it serves as a massive open-air living room for Habaneros. By day, fishermen cast their lines into the turquoise waters. As the sun sets, the wall comes alive with couples, families, musicians, and friends gathering to chat, drink rum, and enjoy the ocean breeze.\n\nA walk along the Malecón offers a cross-section of Cuban life against a backdrop of crumbling, salt-sprayed buildings and the crashing waves of the Straits of Florida. It's an essential experience, especially at sunset when the sky erupts in color and the classic cars cruising by seem to glow.",

      "description": "No trip to Havana is complete without a ride in one of the iconic 1950s American classic cars. These 'almendrones,' as they are locally known, are meticulously maintained relics from a bygone era, gleaming in vibrant shades of pink, turquoise, and red. Taking a city tour in a convertible Cadillac or Chevrolet is one of the most stylish and enjoyable ways to see the sights.\n\nMost tours last for one to two hours and typically cover major landmarks like Plaza de la Revolución, El Morro fortress, the Malecón, and the grand mansions of the Vedado and Miramar districts. It's a fantastic photo opportunity and a truly unique way to experience the city's scale and grandeur.",

This is the home and workshop of artist José Fuster, who has transformed his entire neighborhood into a massive, surrealist art installation inspired by Gaudi's work in Barcelona. Over several decades, Fuster has covered his own home and over 80 neighboring houses with whimsical, colorful mosaic tiles.\n\nWalking through Fusterlandia feels like stepping into a dream. The art depicts Cuban life, fantastical creatures, and Santería symbols. It's a joyful, imaginative, and utterly unique public art project that showcases the incredible creativity and community spirit of the Cuban people.",

Its iconic lighthouse has become a symbol of the city. The fortress was built to protect Havana from pirates and foreign invaders, and its stone walls and cannons tell tales of colonial battles.\n\nVisitors can explore the ramparts, dungeons, and old barracks while enjoying breathtaking panoramic views of the Malecón and the city skyline. It's particularly impressive at sunset. Across the road is the even larger La Cabaña fortress, where a traditional cannon-firing ceremony (El Cañonazo) takes place nightly at 9:00 PM.",

Set in a lush tropical garden in the Marianao district, this legendary institution offers a spectacular showcase of Cuban music and dance. The show features hundreds of performers in extravagant, feathered, and sequined costumes, performing intricate choreography under the stars.\n\nWhile it's a splurge, the Tropicana experience is a throwback to Havana's glamorous golden age. The ticket price usually includes a welcome drink and a bottle of rum to share at your table. It's a night of pure, over-the-top spectacle and vibrant energy that you won't soon forget.",

Its walls are covered in graffiti and signatures from decades of visitors, including Hemingway, Pablo Neruda, and Salvador Allende. The bar claims to be the birthplace of the mojito, and while that's debatable, there's no denying its historic charm.\n\nPush your way through the crowd to the bar, order a famously strong mojito, and listen to the live Son Cubano band that's almost always playing. It's a crowded, touristy, but undeniably classic Havana experience that connects you to the city's storied past.",

While the original Partagás factory behind the Capitolio is now a store, the official tours have been relocated to another working factory. Here, you can watch hundreds of expert 'torcedores' (cigar rollers) sort, roll, and box the famous cigars by hand.\n\nThe tour takes you through the entire process, from the selection of the leaves to the final packaging. The aroma of rich tobacco fills the air, and the skill on display is incredible. It’s an authentic cultural experience that provides a deep appreciation for Cuba's most famous export.",

Flanked by ornate, historic buildings, bronze lion statues, and old-fashioned street lamps, it's one of the most elegant boulevards in the city. It stretches from the Malecón all the way to Parque Central and the magnificent Gran Teatro.\n\nThis is a popular spot for locals to stroll, skateboard, and relax on the marble benches. On weekends, it often hosts art exhibitions and street performances. Walking its length provides a more tranquil experience than the bustling streets of Old Havana and offers a glimpse into the city's former architectural splendor.",

The building itself is a sight to behold, with lavish interiors designed by Tiffany's of New York. Bullet holes from a 1957 student attack on the dictator Batista are still visible on the central staircase.\n\nBehind the museum, in the Granma Memorial pavilion, you'll find the actual yacht that carried Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and 80 other revolutionaries from Mexico to Cuba in 1956. The museum's exhibits are primarily in Spanish, but the artifacts and the grandeur of the setting make it a compelling visit for anyone interested in Cuba's tumultuous past.",

Located on the top floor of the Gómez Vila building on the corner of Plaza Vieja, this unique attraction uses a simple periscope and a series of lenses to project a live, 360-degree image of the city onto a concave screen in a dark room. It was the first of its kind in Latin America.\n\nA guide narrates the 10-minute presentation, pointing out key landmarks and sharing interesting anecdotes about the city below.

The project was started in 1990 by artist Salvador Gonzáles Escalona, who transformed the street into a shrine to Afro-Cuban culture. The walls are covered in murals, sculptures made from bathtubs and scrap metal, and phrases from Santería religions.\n\nIt's a dynamic, ever-evolving art space that feels raw and authentic. The best time to visit is on Sunday around noon, when the alley comes alive with the powerful rhythms of rumba music and dance, drawing in crowds of locals and tourists alike for an unforgettable street party.",

The plaza is dominated by the José Martí Memorial, a towering 109-meter star-shaped monument. Visitors can take an elevator to the top for sweeping views of the city.\n\nAcross the square are the iconic steel outlines of two of the revolution's most revered figures on the facades of government buildings: Che Guevara with the phrase 'Hasta la Victoria Siempre' (Until Victory, Always) and Camilo Cienfuegos with 'Vas Bien, Fidel' (You're doing well, Fidel). The sheer scale and stark modernist design of the plaza make it a powerful and humbling sight.",

Located next to the Capitolio, its neo-baroque facade is adorned with stone and marble statues. It is home to the prestigious Cuban National Ballet, as well as the Cuban National Opera and other performances.\n\nEven if you don't see a show, the building itself is worth admiring from the outside. However, catching a world-class ballet performance for an incredibly low price is a fantastic cultural experience. The lavish, gilded interior and the talent on stage make for a truly memorable evening.",

The most popular and well-serviced of these is Playa Santa María del Mar, which offers wide stretches of sand, clear turquoise water, and plenty of amenities.\n\nYou can rent sunbeds and umbrellas, buy cheap coconuts and cocktails from beachside vendors, and enjoy a fresh seafood lunch at one of the simple 'ranchón' restaurants. It's where Habaneros go to escape the city, making it a great place to relax and people-watch.",

                    <h3>Stroll Along El Malecón</h3>
                    <p>The Malecón is Havana’s legendary 8-kilometer-long esplanade, sea drive, and seawall, stretching from Old Havana to the Vedado neighborhood. It’s often called 'the world’s longest sofa,' as it serves as a massive open-air living room for Habaneros. By day, fishermen cast their lines into the turquoise waters. As the sun sets, the wall comes alive with couples, families, musicians, and friends gathering to chat, drink rum, and enjoy the ocean breeze.

A walk along the Malecón offers a cross-section of Cuban life against a backdrop of crumbling, salt-sprayed buildings and the crashing waves of the Straits of Florida. It's an essential experience, especially at sunset when the sky erupts in color and the classic cars cruising by seem to glow.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Around</h3>
                    <p>Walking is the best way to explore compact areas like Old Havana. For longer distances, you have several options: 'almendrones' (classic American car taxis) for city tours and private trips; yellow state-run taxis (metered); 'colectivos' (shared taxis running fixed routes); and three-wheeled Coco Taxis for short, fun hops. For travel between cities, the Viazul bus service is a reliable option for tourists.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
                    <p>The best way to experience local culture is by staying in a 'Casa Particular' (a private room or apartment rented from a Cuban family). For location, Habana Vieja (Old Havana) offers historic charm and proximity to major sights. Vedado is a more modern neighborhood with grand avenues, theaters, and a lively nightlife. Miramar is an upscale residential district with large hotels and embassies. Top hotel picks include the historic Hotel Nacional de Cuba and the modern Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is Havana expensive?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Havana can be both affordable and expensive, depending on your travel style. Staying in 'Casas Particulares' (around $25-50 USD/night) and eating at local 'paladares' (private restaurants) is very budget-friendly. State-run luxury hotels and high-end restaurants will be significantly more expensive, with prices comparable to major US or European cities. Activities like tours and museum entries are generally affordable. Note that Cuba uses the Cuban Peso (CUP), and it's best to bring cash (Euros or Canadian Dollars are preferred for exchange) as US credit/debit cards do not work.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How many days do you need in Havana?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">To fully experience the highlights of Havana without feeling rushed, 3 to 4 days is ideal. This allows you enough time to explore Old Havana thoroughly, visit key sites in Vedado and Centro Habana, take a classic car tour, and enjoy the nightlife. If you plan to take day trips to nearby places like Viñales (for tobacco plantations) or Varadero (for beaches), you should add at least one full day for each excursion.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is Havana safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Havana is generally considered a very safe city for tourists, with a low rate of violent crime. The biggest concerns are petty crimes like pickpocketing or bag-snatching in crowded areas. Be aware of 'jineteros' (hustlers) who may try to sell you overpriced cigars or offer unsolicited guide services. A firm 'no, gracias' usually suffices. Use common sense, don't flash expensive items, and be cautious at night, just as you would in any major city. Cubans are overwhelmingly friendly and welcoming to visitors.</div>
