Its elegant, cable-stayed design is a powerful symbol of Scandinavian cooperation.\n\nWhile you can experience the bridge by taking a train or car to Copenhagen, one of the best ways to appreciate its scale is from the shore. Head to the 'Luftkastellet' or 'Utsiktsplats Öresundsbron' viewpoint near the Sibbarp camping area. The sight of the bridge arching gracefully over the water, especially at sunrise or sunset, is truly unforgettable.",

                    <p>An engineering masterpiece, the Öresund Bridge is the iconic link between Malmö, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark.

Its elegant, cable-stayed design is a powerful symbol of Scandinavian cooperation.

Head to the 'Luftkastellet' or 'Utsiktsplats Öresundsbron' viewpoint near the Sibbarp camping area.
