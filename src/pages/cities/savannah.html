      "description": "The heart and soul of Savannah is its National Historic Landmark District, a stunningly preserved grid of streets and 22 public squares designed by General James Oglethorpe. Each square has its own unique character, fountain, or monument, shaded by magnificent live oaks draped in Spanish moss. The best way to experience it is on foot, allowing you to wander from one tranquil green space to the next, admiring the surrounding Federal, Georgian, and Greek Revival architecture.\n\nStart in Johnson Square, the first and largest, and make your way to others like Chippewa Square, famous for the bus bench scene in 'Forrest Gump' (the bench is now in a museum), and Madison Square with its statue of Sergeant William Jasper. These squares are not just historic relics; they are the living rooms of the city, hosting farmers' markets, festivals, and locals simply enjoying the day.",

      "description": "Forsyth Park is the largest and most iconic park in the Historic District, spanning 30 acres of lush greenery. It's a hub of local life, where you'll find people jogging, playing frisbee, or relaxing in the shade. The park's most famous feature is the grand cast-iron fountain at the northern end, installed in 1858 and modeled after the one at the Place de la Concorde in Paris. It's one of the most photographed spots in Savannah.\n\nBeyond the fountain, the park features walking paths, a Fragrant Garden for the blind, sports courts, and a large event space. On Saturdays, a bustling farmers' market takes over the southern end of the park. It's the perfect place for a picnic, a leisurely stroll, or simply to soak in the city's enchanting atmosphere.",

      "description": "Made famous by the book and film 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,' Bonaventure Cemetery is a hauntingly beautiful final resting place. Situated on a scenic bluff overlooking the Wilmington River, this Victorian cemetery is known for its stunning sculptures, historic graves, and avenues of ancient live oaks draped in Spanish moss. It's more of a sculpture garden than a simple graveyard.\n\nNotable graves include those of songwriter Johnny Mercer and poet Conrad Aiken. While the 'Bird Girl' statue from the book cover is no longer here (it's at the Telfair Academy), the cemetery's ethereal atmosphere remains. You can explore on your own or take a guided tour to hear the fascinating stories of the people interred here.",

      "description": "Running alongside the Savannah River, River Street is a bustling, energetic promenade with a distinctive historic charm. The street is paved with 200-year-old cobblestones that once served as ballast for ships arriving from Europe. Today, former cotton warehouses have been transformed into a vibrant mix of antique shops, boutiques, pubs, restaurants, and candy stores famous for their pralines.\n\nWatch massive container ships glide by, enjoy a cocktail with a river view, or simply browse the unique shops. The area comes alive at night with live music pouring out of the bars. Don't miss the Waving Girl statue, a tribute to Florence Martus, who greeted ships for over 40 years.",

      "description": "Another star from 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,' the Mercer Williams House is a must-see for fans of the book and anyone interested in Savannah's high-society history and scandal. Designed by John S. Norris for General Hugh W. Mercer (great-grandfather of songwriter Johnny Mercer), construction was completed in 1868. It was later purchased and meticulously restored by Jim Williams, the antiques dealer at the center of the famous murder trial.\n\nThe tour focuses on the magnificent 18th and 19th-century furniture and art that Williams collected, showcasing his impeccable taste. While the tour doesn't sensationalize the infamous events, the palpable history and opulent interiors make it a fascinating glimpse into a secretive and elegant world.",

The tour takes you through the stunning main house, the beautiful parterre garden, and the original carriage house, which includes one of the best-preserved urban slave quarters in the South. This National Historic Landmark provides a crucial, multi-perspective view of history by telling the stories of both the wealthy Owens family and the enslaved people who lived and worked there.\n\nThe thoughtful and honest interpretation of the lives of all residents makes this tour particularly impactful. From the ingenious passive cooling systems in the main house to the stark living conditions in the slave quarters, it's an essential educational experience.",

      "description": "Prepare for a breathtaking entrance. Wormsloe State Historic Site is famed for its spectacular avenue of over 400 live oaks and Spanish moss, which form a mile-and-a-half long tunnel leading to the ruins of a colonial-era estate. This is the postcard image of the romantic South brought to life. The tabby ruins are the oldest standing structure in Savannah, remnants of the fortified home built by Noble Jones, one of Georgia's founding colonists.\n\nBeyond the famous avenue, visitors can explore a museum with artifacts, watch a short film about the site's history, and walk interpretive nature trails that lead past the marsh and through the forest. The site also features costumed interpreters who demonstrate colonial life skills, offering a tangible connection to the past.",

Its towering twin spires are a landmark of the Savannah skyline. Step inside to be awed by the soaring ceilings, intricate gold-leaf detailing, vibrant murals, and stunning Austrian stained-glass windows that depict biblical scenes. Whether you are religious or not, the sheer beauty and craftsmanship of the French Gothic architecture are inspiring.\n\nThe current structure was completed in the late 19th century after the original was destroyed by a fire. It's a peaceful and awe-inspiring sanctuary that offers a quiet respite from the bustling city streets.",

The Telfair Academy, housed in a classical Regency mansion, was the first public art museum in the South. It features 19th- and 20th-century American and European art, including the iconic 'Bird Girl' statue. Next door, the Jepson Center for the Arts is a stunning, modern building that provides a striking contrast. It showcases contemporary art, rotating exhibitions, and an interactive gallery for children.\n\nA single ticket grants access to these two buildings plus the Owens-Thomas House & Slave Quarters, making it an incredible value. This trio offers a comprehensive journey through art history, from classical portraits to cutting-edge contemporary works, all within a few blocks.",

Uniquely located in Savannah, this is the only museum in the country dedicated to the history of the 18th Amendment. Through immersive displays, life-size dioramas, and a cast of costumed characters, you'll learn about the temperance movement, bootlegging, notorious gangsters like Al Capone, and the rise of the speakeasy.\n\nThe museum is highly interactive and entertaining, making history fun for all ages. The experience culminates in an authentic-feeling speakeasy where you can order classic, period-appropriate cocktails (for those 21+). It's a fun, educational, and unique attraction you won't find anywhere else.",

Today, it's a vibrant four-block open-air marketplace filled with art galleries, boutiques, restaurants, and live music. During the day, it's a great place to shop for local art and souvenirs or grab a casual lunch. At night, the area transforms into one of Savannah's nightlife hotspots, with bars and restaurants buzzing with energy.\n\nThe market has a more casual, festive atmosphere than the refined squares, offering a different but equally essential Savannah experience. It's the perfect place to people-watch, discover a new artist, or enjoy a drink on an outdoor patio.",

      "description": "Constituted in 1777, the First African Baptist Church is one of the oldest Black churches in North America. This National Historic Landmark is not only a place of worship but a profound monument to African American history and resilience. The current sanctuary, built by the hands of its enslaved congregation members in the 1850s, holds incredible stories.\n\nTours of the church reveal its role as a stop on the Underground Railroad, pointing out the holes in the floorboards in the shape of a Kongo cosmogram, which were used to provide air to escaped slaves hiding in the space below. The original pews, also built by slaves, are another powerful artifact. A tour here is a moving and essential experience for understanding a deeper side of Savannah's history.",

This grand Greek Revival mansion was one of the first two homes in Georgia to be designated a state landmark. The tour explores the opulent main house and the carriage house, delving into the lives of the Sorrel family and the enslaved people who worked there.\n\nThe home is famous for its paranormal activity and has been featured on numerous ghost hunting shows. Whether you take a daytime history tour or a nighttime ghost tour, the impressive architecture, beautifully preserved interiors, and compelling stories of its former residents make for an unforgettable visit.",

Founded by three brothers from Greece, the shop has retained its nostalgic charm, complete with a classic soda fountain, black-and-white photos, and original fixtures. The ice cream itself is legendary, made using the same secret, super-premium recipes for over a century.\n\nBe prepared for a line, as this spot is incredibly popular with locals and tourists alike. Try the signature Tutti Frutti flavor, a rum-based ice cream with candied fruit and Georgia pecans, or other classics like Butter Pecan and Chocolate Chewies & Cream. It's a delicious taste of history.",

It's the perfect place to swim, sunbathe, or try some water sports.

Start in Johnson Square, the first and largest, and make your way to others like Chippewa Square, famous for the bus bench scene in 'Forrest Gump' (the bench is now in a museum), and Madison Square with its statue of Sergeant William Jasper. These squares are not just historic relics; they are the living rooms of the city, hosting farmers' markets, festivals, and locals simply enjoying the day.</p>
